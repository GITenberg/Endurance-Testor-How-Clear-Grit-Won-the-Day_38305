<b>A SERIES OF BOOKS FOR BOYS</b><br />

<b>Which, in addition to the interesting boy scout stories by CAPTAIN ALAN<br />
DOUGLAS, Scoutmaster, contain articles on nature lore, native animals<br />
and a fund of other information pertaining to out-of-door life,<br />
that will appeal to the boy's love of the open.</b></div>


<div class='unindent'><b>I. The Campfires of the Wolf Patrol</b></div>

<div class="blockquot">Their first camping experience affords the scouts splendid opportunities to use
their recently acquired knowledge in a practical way. Elmer <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Chenoweth'">Chenowith</ins>, a lad
from the northwest woods, astonishes everyone by his familiarity with camp
life. A clean, wholesome story every boy should read.</div>


<div class='unindent'><b>II. Woodcraft; or, How a Patrol Leader Made Good</b></div>

<div class="blockquot">This tale presents many stirring situations in which some of the boys are called
upon to exercise all their ingenuity and unselfishness. A story filled with
healthful excitement.</div>


<div class='unindent'><b>III. Pathfinder; or, The Missing Tenderfoot</b></div>

<div class="blockquot">Some mysteries are cleared up in a most unexpected way, greatly to the credit
of our young friends. A variety of incidents follow fast, one after the other.</div>


<div class='unindent'><b>IV. Fast Nine; or, a Challenge From Fairfield</b></div>

<div class="blockquot">They show the same team-work here as when in camp. The description of the
final game with the team of a rival town, and the outcome thereof, form a
stirring narrative. One of the best baseball stories of recent years.</div>


<div class='unindent'><b>V. Great Hike; or, The Pride of The Khaki Troop</b></div>

<div class="blockquot">After weeks of preparation the scouts start out on their greatest undertaking.
Their march takes them far from home, and the good-natured rivalry of the
different patrols furnishes many interesting and amusing situations.</div>


<div class='unindent'><b>VI. Endurance Test; or, How Clear Grit Won the Day</b></div>

<div class="blockquot">Few stories "get" us more than illustrations of pluck in the face of apparent
failure. Our heroes show the stuff they are made of and surprise their most
ardent admirers. One of the best stories Captain Douglas has written.</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Let</span> Adam Limburger have a try, fellows!"</p>

<p>"Yes, give the new tenderfoot scout a chance to show
what he can do in the water."</p>

<p>"That's the ticket; just watch him take the high dive,
will you, boys?"</p>

<p>"Mine gootness gracious, poys, oxcuse me, if you blease.
If you dink I can dot blunge make vidoudt upsetting mineself,
you haf anudder guess coming."</p>

<p>"Try it, Adam!"</p>

<p>"You've just got to, you know, old chap! Everybody's
jumped but you; and all the while you've just sat there
on the bank and watched us cutting up!"</p>

<p>"Shut your eyes, Adam, if you're timid, and then go;
head or feet first, we don't care which, so long as you
make a big splash."</p>

<p>"Ach, idt vould not, pe sooch a surprises if Adam he
preaks his neck: put, poys, if dot happens, somepody carry
de news to mine mudder. Py chimineddy, here I go!"</p>

<p>"Get out of the way, Ty Collins, if you don't want to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
get squashed; for here comes Adam down the shoot-the-shoot
plunge!"</p>

<p>A number of lads were in swimming out in the country
quite a number of miles away from the home town of
Hickory Ridge. Besides the stout German who was standing
in a hesitating way on the springboard that had been
thrust out from the high bank, some ten feet above the
water, there were Elmer Chenowith, Ty Collins, Landy
Smith, and Ted Burgoyne, the latter of whom, though
afflicted with a decided lisp, was looked upon with considerable
respect among his fellows in the Boy Scout troop,
because of his knowledge of medicine and the rudiments of
surgery.</p>

<p>They had been splashing and having a splendid time for
at least ten minutes after entering the water, when somebody
happened to notice that the new recruit in the Hickory
Ridge troop of Boy Scouts, Adam Litzburgh, a name that
had been quickly corrupted into Limburger by the boys, did
not seem to enter into the sport, but contented himself with
either dipping his feet into the water, as if afraid, or else
sitting ashore in the shade watching his new mates.</p>

<p>Adam seemed to be inclined toward stoutness, although
hardly in the same class with Landy, who had long been
bantered by his chums on account of his ever-increasing
tendency to put on flesh in spite of all he could do.</p>

<p>"Lock at the board bend, would you, fellows!" cried
Ty Collins, as the German recruit stood there, balancing at
the end, as though fearful of what the result would be
should he jump.</p>

<p>"He's glued to it, that's what," said Landy, who was
anxious to discover whether Adam would make a greater
splash than he himself produced when he came down like
a huge frog into the water of the Sweetwater River; for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
this was not the familiar "swimming-hole" of the Hickory
Ridge boys, but miles farther away from home.</p>

<p>Adam made several violent gestures as though he might
be going to jump, and then shook his head vigorously in
the negative.</p>

<p>"Noddings doing, poys!" he grinned.</p>

<p>"Hey, none of that crawfishing, now, Adam!" cried
Ty. "You've just <i>got</i> to jump, once anyhow. We'll
stand by and yank you out if you can't swim. Perhaps
the boys over in your beloved Yarmany don't learn as
early as Yankees do. Go on, now!"</p>

<p>"Want us to come up there and push you off, you Dutch
cheese!" called Landy, in the hope of arousing the belligerent
nature of the Teuton, and thus making him conquer
his timidity.</p>

<p>"Vell, py shiminy crickets, off you dink you can scare
Adam Litzburgh, poys, you haf anudder guess goming.
Look oudt pelow!"</p>

<p>Elmer had been watching the antics of Adam with a
critical eye. Before these last words were spoken he had
turned to Ted, who chanced to be swimming near him, and
remarked significantly:</p>

<p>"That fellow is pulling the wool over the eyes of Ty and
Landy."</p>

<p>"Think tho?" asked Ted, quickly.</p>

<p>"Just watch and see," replied the other, who, besides
being the leader of his patrol, known as the Wolf Patrol,
was also the assistant scout master of the troop and authorized
by certificate from the headquarters of the organization
to assume the duties of Mr. Garrabrant whenever
that gentleman was away on business.</p>

<p>Suddenly Adam gave a bound up and down until the
springy board had taken on a motion superior to anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
that had been done by the others in their efforts to
excel.</p>

<p>As it came up finally, the body of the German boy leaped
into the air. Those who were watching with distended eyes
saw him turn over twice before he struck the surface of
the water, beneath which he shot with the grace of a fish.</p>

<p>Elmer gave a shout.</p>

<p>"I thought as much; Adam was hoodwinking you,
boys!" he laughed.</p>

<p>"Wow, did you ever see the like of that! A double
somersault before he struck, and then he dived under like
a greenback frog from a log!" and Landy's fat face was
a study as he looked his utter amazement.</p>

<p>"I take it all back!" shouted Ty. "They <i>do</i> know
how to dive over in Yarmany and beat us all hollow. Say,
fellows, I bet you Adam is going to prove to be the best
water dog in all Hickory Ridge. Look at him swimming
there, will you? I've seen an otter or a muskrat doing it
that way, but never a boy. Ain't he the peach though!
I take off my hat to Adam!"</p>

<p>"That'th what we all thay!" cried Ted, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Three cheers for our new comrade, fellows; here's to
Adam, and may he prove as great a find as a true scout
as he has a water duck!" exclaimed Elmer.</p>

<p>The cheers rang out, and were followed with a "tiger."
Adam was coming back now, and his red face beamed with
satisfaction. They had been inclined to look on him as a
real greenhorn; and no doubt that was what he would prove
to be with regard to most of the ways of woodcraft in
which scouts desire to become proficient; but the boy
from across the big water had certainly surprised his new
mates this day by his expertness at diving and swimming.</p>

<p>So long as they remained in the water they kept Adam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
busy showing off. He had a dozen clever tricks from the
springboard; and there was no one in Hickory Ridge who,
as Ty declared, could "hold a candle to him."</p>

<p>"No, nor in Fairfield, either," said Elmer, after he had
seen what the German lad could do; "and if we ever have
another series of rival tests with our friends over there,
make up your minds, fellows, that Adam will stand in a
class all his own."</p>

<p>Finally, when some of the boys began to show signs of
blue lips, Elmer declared they had been in long enough.
When one is not accustomed to being in the water at all
hours, the vitality of the system is exhausted after a certain
time; and those who are wise will make it a point to
come out before they get to shivering, even on a hot September
day, like the one that found these Hickory Ridge scouts
in camp up on the Sweetwater.</p>

<p>A few of the boys, it seemed, had not had quite enough
of outdoor life during the long vacation and they had
induced Elmer to start out for three days more of camping,
taking a tent along and a few things calculated to add to
their comfort.</p>

<p>Adam, as the latest addition to the troop, asked permission
to accompany them, and as he was something of a
comical fellow they expected to have more or less fun at
his expense as a greenhorn.</p>

<p>After this remarkable experience, however, some of them
began to suspect that the shoe might frequently prove to be
on the other foot; and that the German boy would turn
the tables on them, even as he had done in the water test.</p>

<p>The tent was pitched close by, at a point selected by
Elmer as the best to be found along that part of the river.
The ground had the proper drainage in case of a heavy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
storm and was not under any high tree, so that the danger
from lightning was reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>They had brought a few things along to eat; and as
farms lay not far away, each day some of the scouts trailed
over to one of these in order to purchase other articles,
such as fresh milk, eggs, butter, and green corn, and on
this morning Elmer had brought back a couple of fine
chickens which a farmer had presented to him.</p>

<p>Of course, the rest of the boys understood that at some
past time Elmer must have done the farmer a favor; for
he was always eager to lend a helping hand when an occasion
arose; but he declined to tell the story, and as they
had the chickens the boys found no fault.</p>

<p>Elmer had made an oven in the ground, after the type
used by hunters in many lands. A deep hole was scooped
out, and a hot fire kept going for some hours; then the
red ashes were removed, and the chickens, properly wrapped
in big leaves, placed in the oven which was then hermetically
sealed with clay.</p>

<p>This might be called the first "fireless cooker." It is
the very principle upon which all those now on the market
are constructed; and, indeed, the bottles that are guaranteed
to keep their contents hot for twenty-four hours are
fashioned on some similar lines for retaining the heat.</p>

<p>For six hours now had those spring roasters been in "hot
storage," as Landy called it, and many were the appeals
to Elmer to know if they would be ready by the time they
had the corn and other things done.</p>

<p>The afternoon was wasting away. In another hour the
sun would be setting. Elmer was busying himself at the
fire with Ty, who claimed to be something of a cook and
had proved this on various occasions. Ted was overhauling
the little case of remedies, without which he seldom went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
anywhere. Adam and Landy had taken a small camera,
loaned by one of the other members of the troop, a tall
scout known to his chums as "Lil Artha," and with this
they expected to take a few snapshots of the camp, the
picturesque river as seen in the afternoon glow, and such
things as appeal to the average boy looking around for
subjects on which to execute his skill as a photographer.</p>

<p>They could be heard rummaging among the bushes not
far away, and Landy seemed to be getting more or less fun
out of the German tenderfoot, who was utterly new to the
ways of the American woods, however familiar he might
be with any species of water.</p>

<p>Elmer had just made up his mind, after a sly investigation
on his own account, that the chickens were deliciously
done, and hence there need be no further delay about starting
the balance of the dinner, when he heard Landy's
rather whining voice approaching, and raised his head to
watch.</p>

<p>When the two came into camp it was noticed that Adam
seemed to be leading his companion, who was acting rather
queer. At first Elmer wondered whether the fat boy could
have been overcome by the heat, for his face was unusually
red. Then he saw that Landy seemed anxious to dig his
knuckles into his eyes.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Landy?" asked Ty, whose attention
had also been directed to the incoming pair.</p>

<p>"I declare if I know what to make of it, fellows," said
the fat boy, as he stood there, trying to grin at them, though
he certainly looked foolish, with his cheeks beginning to
puff out and furiously red. "Just can't seem to see right.
Feels like my eyes were going to close. And no wasp stung
me, either; that is, as far as I know. It feels awful tough,
I tell you now, and that's no joke."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Elmer bent forward to look closer.</p>

<p>Then his face assumed a serious expression.</p>

<p>"Well, I should say it wasn't a joke, Landy!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"But what's the matter with me, Elmer; tell a fellow,
won't you?" pleaded the afflicted one.</p>

<p>"Why, you're poisoned, that's what!" declared Elmer.</p>

<p>Landy immediately let out a whoop; but although he was
undoubtedly frightened, it seemed as though his face could
not possibly turn white, as might have been expected under
the circumstances.</p>

<p>"Me poisoned!" he exclaimed. "Oh, whatever do you
mean, Elmer!" he cried, laying a puffy hand on the sleeve
of the other's outing shirt, which he had rolled up above
his elbow in order to have greater freedom in his movements.</p>

<p>"You've been foolish enough," Elmer went on with
grave concern in his voice, "Landy, to handle that rank
stuff, poison ivy, and then rubbed your hands all over your
face. You've got a dose, all right, I'm afraid!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SIGNS OF TROUBLE AHEAD.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Landy</span> was certainly badly frightened. The grave manner
in which the patrol leader said this with regard to the
ivy poisoning seemed to add to his alarm. Some of the boys
afterwards declared that his knees knocked together, but
this the fat boy always indignantly denied.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was with an almost plaintive expression
that he proceeded to inquire further about his prospects.</p>

<p>"Poison ivy, you say, Elmer? Was that the stuff growing
around that tree we rubbed up against? But Adam
was in just as deep as I was; why don't his face burn and
turn red like mine?" he asked, as though he considered it
rank injustice that he should be picked out as a victim,
when another, equally guilty, went scot-free from harm.</p>

<p>"That's the queer thing about poison ivy," replied
Elmer. "While it's bound to act on most people, more or
less, a few can handle it without any bad result."</p>

<p>"That's so," broke in Ty just then. "Why, I've known
fellers that would begin to itch and burn if they even set
eyes on the old stuff, and I reckon I'm liable to get a little
turn myself; had one spell and they kept doctoring me
for a week at home. Hand full of little water blisters, and
I had to be mighty careful, for when they broke they poisoned
wherever the fluid ran. Wow, hope I don't get it
again, that's all!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my goodness gracious! What's going to become of
me, then?" gasped poor Landy. "Because I've been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
crazy enough to rub it all over my face. Me for the hospital,
I guess!"</p>

<p>"Wait!"</p>

<p>It was Ted who said this, and somehow the very confident
tone in which he spoke awakened a wild hope in the heart
of the lad who was in trouble.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ted, can <i>you</i> do anything for me?" he asked,
eagerly, transferring his attention from Elmer to the other,
who had arisen after listening to all that had been said,
and now approached the group.</p>

<p>"Let me look at you firtht," remarked the budding doctor
of the troop, gravely.</p>

<p>He examined the face and hands of the boy closely.</p>

<p>"When did you rub up againth that vine?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why," replied Landy, "just a little bit ago, when
Adam was helping me get a snapshot of the camp. It was
in the way and we pulled it off the tree. Fact is, I tripped
over the old thing and got mad, so I yanked it loose, and
Adam, he helped."</p>

<p>"Then let me tell you, in the firtht plathe, that I don't
believe it'th poithon ivy at all, becauthe that doethn't begin
to thow for theveral hourth," said Ted.</p>

<p>"Oh, bully for you, Ted; it makes me glad to hear you
say that!" exclaimed the boy who was in trouble. "But
mebbe you can tell if you see the old vine?"</p>

<p>"Courthe I can, and here'th Elmer who knowth all about
it, too. Did it have jutht three leaveth to each thtem, do
you remember?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I didn't pay any attention to the leaves, I was so
anxious to drag the old thing away so as to get a better
view," replied Landy.</p>

<p>Elmer beckoned to Adam, and the two hurried off.
Everyone knew that they had gone to view the vine that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
had been accused of doing so terrible a thing to the fat
boy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dr. Ted had picked up a little bag which
he usually carried with a shoulder strap. Every fellow in
the troop knew what that same bag contained; and indeed,
many of them had found reason to bless the forethought
that induced their chum to bring it along on every trip
for emergencies such as the present. Ted delighted to call
it his "vade mecum," and most of the scouts had only a
hazy conception of what those words meant, though they
appreciated the bag all right.</p>

<p>"If it wath really poithon ivy," went on Ted, "the firtht
thing to be done would be to wath the thurfathe of the thkin
with warm water, and then apply thith weak tholution of
permanganate of potath. It'th about three per thent, and
the color of wine, you thee. It'll dithcolor the thkin, of
courthe, and for a while Landy can path for an Injun; but
it doeth the work. Elmer put me in touch with the good it
can do. He thayth every hunter of big game out in India
and Africa alwayth carrieth thome along, to take out the
poithon if he geth clawed by a tiger, a lion or any other
carnivorouth beatht."</p>

<p>There was some hot water, fortunately, and in another
minute the quick-witted camp doctor had bathed the face
and hands of the patient with this, as warm as Landy could
stand <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ith'">it</ins>. Then he started to apply the contents of the
small bottle, to the intense enjoyment of Ty who seemed to
consider the whole thing in the light of a huge joke.</p>

<p>"Say, you'll be a beaut, Landy, and no mistake!"
he chuckled.</p>

<p>"What's that matter, if it only does the business?" demanded
the other.</p>

<p>"That'th common thenthe, anyhow," commented Ted, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
he continued to make sure that every inch of affected skin
was liberally treated with the liquid, which, as he said before,
was of a magenta color.</p>

<p>"There comes Elmer, and now we'll know," remarked
Ty.</p>

<p>The other two came hurrying back to camp. Poor Landy,
whose eyes were really looking half shut, turned a beseeching
gaze upon the patrol leader.</p>

<p>"Was it poison ivy, Elmer?" he asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Not in a thousand years," came the hearty reply.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's almost too good to be true!" said Landy,
with the tears standing in his eyes, for he had begun to fear
that he was in for a horrible experience.</p>

<p>"What was it then?" asked Ty.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied the other. "Some of your
plants here are strange to me, and I reckon it's able to bring
on a burning and a swelling sensation in a hurry, like lots
of them are, with some people. But it can't be anything
as bad as the real rhus tox. I've seen some serious cases
of poisoning from ivy. And, Ted, I think you're doing
the wise thing to use that potash solution."</p>

<p>"It can't do any harm," remarked the doctor, "and you
thee, it'th bound to do thome good. Of courthe Landy will
look like the dickenth for theveral dayth, but he'th a lucky
boy if he geth off that eathy."</p>

<p>"Sure I am," affirmed the victim, readily. "Paint
away all you like. Tell you what, fellers, she feels some
better already. Perhaps, after all, I won't have to be led
home with my face lookin' like a big punkin and my eyes
out of sight."</p>

<p>"We may be happy yet," remarked Ty, who could be
cheerful because it was not <i>his</i> face that burned and stung
as though nettles had done their work. "And, Elmer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
would you mind if I once more turned my attention to
getting grub ready? I've got a terrible vacuum down here,
and you know we learned at school that Nature abhors a
vacuum."</p>

<p>"I'll do more and help you get supper ready, Ty," replied
the other. "We can leave Landy in the hands of
Dr. Ted. He'll make him lie down and rest; and above
all things keep his hands from his face. It's good he took
hold of the case so quick, for the poison hasn't had much
chance to get in."</p>

<p>So the work went on, two of the boys hovering over the
fire that had been started, while Adam ran errands for Dr.
Ted. Landy was given a blanket and told to keep quiet,
but he insisted on lying so that he could watch the cooks out
of the corners of his eyes, and every now and then he would
sniff the air as though his appetite had not been entirely
chased away by his misfortune.</p>

<p>When the coffee was done boiling, the Boston baked
beans heated to a turn and everything ready, Elmer opened
the odd oven in the ground.</p>

<p>"Why, they're nearly as hot as when we put 'em in!"
declared the wondering Ty, as he unwrapped the two young
chickens that had come from the friendly farmer.</p>

<p>Landy sat upright presently.</p>

<p>"Here, don't you dare to forget me!" he called out, as
he saw the others about to sit down around the spot where
the supper was spread.</p>

<p>"But sick people should never eat a bite," declared Ty,
unable to resist the opportunity to tantalize the patient,
whose one weakness lay in his enormous appetite, which
he could never seem to control.</p>

<p>"I ain't sick, though," retorted the other, getting up
with an effort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"I always heard that it was the right thing to starve a
fever, and stuff a cold," Ty went on, deliberately helping
himself to a portion of a fowl, which almost fell to pieces
in his hands, it was so tender and well done; "and I guess
you've got the fever, all right. Anyhow, you're as red
as a chief in the Buffalo Bill show."</p>

<p>"Oh, let up on that, Ty Collins!" cried Landy, indignantly.
"Just give me half a chance, and I'll mighty
soon show you who's sick around here. I can make them
chickens look that way, I want you to know. Here, make
room for me! Looks don't count in camp. Just think I'm
sunburned, that's all. Elmer, help me to some of that
delicious coffee, won't you? I've been smelling it this long
time. It would go right to the spot, I believe."</p>

<p>"Sure I will, Landy," replied the other, smilingly;
"and it does me good to know you're feeling so much
better. But let's hope this will be a lesson to you never to
handle vines that you don't know."</p>

<p>"It will, I promise you, Elmer," replied the other, earnestly.
"And the first time you run across some of the
genuine poison ivy just call me, please. I've heard so
much about it that I want to know the stuff so I can
beware."</p>

<p>"I saw some only a few hours back, and to-morrow I'm
going to take you and Adam and Ty there to impress its
looks on your minds. It may save you a heap of suffering
if you expect to roam much in the woods after this."</p>

<p>Landy was feeling much better. Indeed, the swelling
seemed to be going down rapidly, and even the burning,
itching sensation had yielded to the application of that
wonderful remedy.</p>

<p>Everybody, even Ty, felt glad of this, for Landy was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
jolly chum and they must miss him very much had he been
compelled to be taken home in suffering.</p>

<p>"Hot work, this cooking in summer weather, fellows,"
observed Ty, as he looked up from cleaning off his tin
platter.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you shed that terrible old red
sweater?" suggested Elmer, though he knew beforehand
that Ty would find lots of excuses for declining.</p>

<p>Winter and summer, Ty always wore that old flaming
sweater when engaged in any outdoor game, whether it
be skating, playing hockey, football, baseball, or even going
fishing. The season seemed to make no difference to him,
though some of his chums declared that the mere sight of
the thing made them perspire.</p>

<p>"What, this!" he exclaimed, as though astonished that
anyone should mention the subject. "Why, I just couldn't
do a thing minus my jolly old sweater. It's been on all
sorts of jobs with me. I look on it as my best friend.
Nobody knows how many colds it's saved me from. I'd just
feel lost without it on, that's what."</p>

<p>"But in hot weather like this it must make you
swelter," continued Elmer.</p>

<p>"Not much it don't. Why, don't you know it <i>keeps the
warmth out</i>? That's what I read once, and I believe in it,
too. Besides, all the fellers have got so used to seeing me
with it on that they'd pass me by if I dropped it," grinned
Ty.</p>

<p>"That'th tho," remarked Ted.</p>

<p>No one suspected just then what an important part that
same red sweater was to play in a game that might change
Ty's mind, and that before many hours had passed.</p>

<p>The supper was pronounced prime, and a vote of thanks
taken for the farmer who had once been a boy himself and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
could appreciate the appetite of five fellows who were camping
out.</p>

<p>A tent had been brought along, and into this the five
crowded when the hour had grown late, and everyone admitted
that he was "real sleepy."</p>

<p>Nothing out of the way happened during the night.
There were no wild animals of any consequence around that
part of the country, although farther north hunters got
deer, and even a black bear had been shot the previous
spring. Now and then a sly fox would create a little excitement
among the neighboring farmers by slipping into
their henroosts and carrying off a fat fowl. Mink might
be found along the smaller tributaries to the Sweetwater;
muskrats were plentiful in the marsh land, and some smart
trappers made quite a little sum taking these small animals
during the season.</p>

<p>Of course raccoons and possums abounded, as they always
do around the smaller towns all through the middle East.
Elmer, waking in the night and coming out to stretch
his legs because the presence of five in a small tent
cramped the quarters somewhat, amused himself for some
time in listening to the various sounds that came from the
woods close by.</p>

<p>To one not familiar with the voices of the forest folks,
these might have passed as unmeaning noises, but he could
place every one. In imagination he saw the bushy-tailed
coon trying to scoop up a fish from the end of the log
that ran down into the water; he could follow the movements
of the fat possum climbing the tree to her nest in a
hollow limb, and that angry snarling he understood came
from a couple of slim mink who had met while patrolling
the bank of a small creek on their nightly rounds.</p>

<p>Morning came at last, and as the boys emerged from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
tent, the first thing they did was to take a plunge in the
river. Even Landy was on hand, looking very comical, it is
true, with his stained hands and face, but feeling quite
"chipper," as he declared, when Elmer asked concerning
the state of his health.</p>

<p>They could all swim, of course, even Landy, who earlier
in the season had been utterly ignorant concerning the first
rudiments of how to keep afloat; but association with the
other scouts in camp had caused him to take lessons, and
Elmer had shown him how useful the knowledge of swimming
may prove to any boy at some unexpected time.</p>

<p>"Whose turn to go for milk this morning?" asked Elmer,
after they had dressed.</p>

<p>"I reckon it's mine," remarked Ty. "Some other fellow
must start getting breakfast, then. Perhaps Adam
may turn out as good a cook as he is a diver. Here, give
me the directions how to take that short cut to the farmer's
shack."</p>

<p>So, presently, Ty wandered off, carrying the tin pail for
the milk. The getting of breakfast went on apace. Adam
seemed willing to act as an assistant to Elmer, and between
them they soon had things in an advanced stage.</p>

<p>"Thay, that Ty ought to be here with the lacteal fluid,"
remarked Ted, who often amused his chums by spouting
big words.</p>

<p>"That's so," remarked Elmer, "and as Adam is busy
here and poor old Landy recuperating from a bad attack
of sunburn, I'll appoint you a committee of one to meander
along the trail and hustle Ty up."</p>

<p>Ted hurried away, for he was beginning to feel the gnawing
sensation of a hunger that always attacks growing boys
soon after arising. Besides, that cold dip seemed to just
give them all an additional zest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten minutes later Landy jumped up in considerable excitement.</p>

<p>"Look there, fellers!" he exclaimed, pointing along
the trail over which Ted had recently passed, "ain't that
our chum Ted comin' back on the dead run and waving
his hands like fun? Tell you what, something's just gone
and happened to Ty! That's what he gets for making fun
of me. P'raps he's run across a rattlesnake! You know
that farmer said they killed one up here last year, and we
did the same early this season. Oh, my, I hope not!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LURE OF THE RED FLAG.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What's</span> the matter?" demanded Elmer, as Ted came
reeling into camp, quite out of breath; but upon seeing
that the other had a huge grin on his face he knew the
news he was bringing could not be so very serious after all.</p>

<p>"Ty!" was all the runner could gasp at first.</p>

<p>"Yes, what about him?" Elmer exclaimed; while
Landy laid a quivering hand on Ted's arm and inquired:</p>

<p>"'Taint a rattlesnake, I hope, this time, Ted?"</p>

<p>The other shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p>"Bull!" he articulated.</p>

<p>"Oh, he means that our poor pard has been chewed up
by a bulldog!" cried Landy. "And Ty never did like
dogs, either; only hot ones at the county fair."</p>

<p>"No, no!" whispered Ted. "Gentleman cow, you thee,
and the motht thavage looking beatht ever. Wow!"</p>

<p>"A bull! Now I know what you mean," Landy went
on, as the light of understanding broke over his mottled
countenance. "Some of these farmers up here do keep
terrors, and enter them in the exhibition for prizes. But
what did the bull do to our poor chum Ty?"</p>

<p>"Don't know; didn't ask Ty," replied the other, now
beginning to get his breath back again fairly well, so that
his voice, lisp and all, was audible. "You thee, I wath
jutht about to thaunter acroth a field, when I heard thome
one yelling like the dickenth. Then I thaw a big red bull
pawing the grath at the foot of a tree; and there wath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Ty, ath big ath life, thitting up on a limb. That'th all I
thaw, for the bull tharted after me, and I got over the
fenthe like fun."</p>

<p>The boys stared at each other; then a wide grin began
to appear on their faces. Since it seemed as though their
chum had not been seriously injured they could not resist
the temptation to chuckle over the comical aspect of the
adventure.</p>

<p>"Say, perhaps the bull just went and heaved Ty up in
that tree," suggested Landy.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hardly think it went as far as that," said Elmer.
"The chances are, Ty had plenty of warning, and climbed
without any help from the beast."</p>

<p>"But why would the bull hang around all the time?"
asked the fat boy, wonderingly. "Bulls don't feed on
boys, do they?"</p>

<p>"Not very often," laughed Elmer. "But they do seem
to hate a certain color above all things on this earth. You
remember that the Spaniards use a red flag to make the
bull attack in the ring?"</p>

<p>Then Landy saw a great light.</p>

<p>"Ty's famous old red sweater, that's what!" he
shouted. "It's gone and pulled him into a peck of trouble,
for a fact. And just last night he was blowing about
what a great help it had been to him. Say, he must be
in a nice pickle now, hey?"</p>

<p>"Breakfast will have to wait a while," declared Elmer;
"while the whole bunch of us sally out to rescue our
chum in distress. You know the rules of the organization.
Come on, fellows."</p>

<p>Even while speaking, Elmer had placed the coffee pot
and the frying pan aside, as far away from the fire as they
could go without losing their heat. Adam, Landy and Ted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
were apparently only too willing to accompany him on his
errand of mercy.</p>

<p>Following a trail that led through the woods, they
finally came to an open field. It had just one tree, and
that growing some distance from the high rail fence.</p>

<p>"There's the bull, just as Ted said," remarked Elmer,
as they looked.</p>

<p>"And he's about the ugliest critter I ever laid eyes on,
for a fact," remarked Landy. "My goodness! Look at
him tossing up the dirt with those nasty little black horns,
would you! And he's punched holes through that tin pail
the farmer's women folks loaned us, too. I can see Ty now,
because of that nice red sweater he wears. He's waving
at us, and there he shouts!"</p>

<p>"Hey, call him off, fellers! Somebody go and coax him
around to that other end of the field. I want to come
down. Been up here 'most an hour, I guess, and I'm getting
tired of it. Elmer, you know how to do the business.
Landy, s'pose you climb over and let him see you. He
won't be able to resist trying for such a fat prize!"</p>

<p>"Listen to his nerve, boys," complained Landy. "He
wants me to sacrifice myself on the altar of friendship for
him. Just as if I could ever climb over this fence again,
if that holy terror came snorting and rampaging for me!
I guess not."</p>

<p>"No need to, Landy," laughed Elmer, as he noted the
indignation of the fat boy. "We'll find some way to get
Ty out of his fix without taking chances of your climbing
a fence in one, two, three order."</p>

<p>"Hurry up!" came floating across the field from the
tree, among the branches of which the owner of the red
sweater was waving frantically.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Firtht thing to be done, he ought to get out of that
thweater, don't you think, Elmer?" inquired Ted.</p>

<p>"That's right, and I'll tell him so"; and, accordingly,
raising his voice, he informed Ty that if he expected them
to do anything toward effecting his rescue he must rid
himself of the garment that was exciting the fighting spirit
in the bull.</p>

<p>Of course that went against the grain of Ty; but when
the others refused to make the first move until he had
complied, he went about the task with evident ill humor.</p>

<p>"But he ain't leaving it hanging in the tree, Elmer,"
announced Landy, whose eyesight seemed to be all right
this morning, however defective it may have been on the
previous evening after his engagement with that poison
vine. "He's stuffing it inside his shirt, I do declare!"</p>

<p>"Well, that doesn't matter," the patrol leader remarked;
"so long as he gets rid of it. And now, boys,
you stay here to help him over when he comes. I'm going
to go around to the other side and tempt the bull. Fortunately
I've got a red bandana handkerchief myself,
which I wear cowboy style around my neck; and that
ought to be a good enough bait for Mr. Bull."</p>

<p>"Oh, be careful, Elmer; don't stay in the field too long,
because he might get you," pleaded Landy.</p>

<p>"You let Elmer alone," said Ted. "He knowth hith
buthineth all right. He cometh from the ranch country,
where they breed bullth. All right, Elmer; we'll get buthy
when Ty getth here. Good luck to you!"</p>

<p>Elmer, when a little distance away, stopped to hold a
short talk with the boy up in the tree. It happened that
the border of the field varied, and this spot was a trifle
closer than any other.</p>

<p>"Now, listen, Ty," he shouted, after he had succeeded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
in attracting the attention of the other; "I'm going over
to that spot that's farthest away. When the bull gets a
good start for me, you slip down, and run for all you're
worth straight to where the other fellows are waiting.
Try and keep the trunk of the tree between you and the
bull all you can. And if he chases you too hard, throw
that red sweater aside. He may stop to toss it a few
times, and that'll give you a chance to make the fence.
Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's all clear enough; but hold his attention as
long as you can, Elmer, because it looks like a whole mile
over to that fence!" Ty called back.</p>

<p>So Elmer kept on around the field. The place he had
selected as the scene of operations was exactly opposite
where he had left the other three fellows; and he considered
this a favorable circumstance, indeed, as it increased
the chances of the boy in the tree.</p>

<p>When he had finally arrived, Elmer took the red bandana
handkerchief from his neck, and climbed over the
fence. Of course, not being a professional bullfighter, he
did not mean to get far away from his base, and expected
to make good use of that same fence when the crisis came.</p>

<p>Immediately he began to shout and wave that defiant
banner, the bull took notice. Since the color that he detested
so heartily seemed to have been transferred from
the boy in the tree to the one on the ground, so the interest
of the bull changed.</p>

<p>He instantly started on a mad run toward Elmer, galloping
along in a way that seemed to indicate a desire to
be out after business.</p>

<p>"Get down, quick, Ty, and run for all you're worth!"
shouted Elmer, still waving his bandana, and at the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
time trying to correctly gauge the speed of his enemy,
so that he could get out of harm's way in ample time.</p>

<p>"Jump, Elmer!" shrieked Landy, who was perched on
the top of the fence across the field, and could not tell just
how close the bull had arrived to his chum.</p>

<p>Ty had meanwhile dropped out of the tree, and was
heading for them as fast as his nimble legs, aided by his
fright, could carry him. But as he had said, it was quite
some distance, and his heart seemed to be in his mouth
every second of the time he was in transit.</p>

<p>"There! Elmer's made for the fence at last!" cried
Landy. "Oh, look at that rush of the bull, would you!
But Elmer was too quick for him, and he's over the fence
and out. Oh, my, just hear that crash when the old bull
banged into the fence! Now, will you be good, you monster?
He's looking around, and I just hope he don't see
poor old Ty making this way!"</p>

<p>"Py chimineddy! He's goming pack!" declared Adam.</p>

<p>"He is, and like a whirlwind, too!" gasped Landy.
"Oh! now we won't be able to help our chum a little
bit. Run faster, Ty; let out another kink! He's after
you!"</p>

<p>Evidently there was no need to tell poor Ty that dismal
fact, for he had been taking frequent observations over
his left shoulder as he galloped along. Perhaps he did
let out another "kink," as Landy expressed it; but if so,
the fact was not very noticeable, so rapidly was the bull
overtaking him.</p>

<p>But Ty had not forgotten that last instruction given
him by the one who knew bulls from the ground up, their
little weaknesses as well as their ferocious habits. The
friendly fence, with his three anxious chums perched on the
top rail, was not so very far away; but to his eyes it seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
a long distance, and he just knew he could never make it
before being overtaken.</p>

<p>In vain did Landy, Adam and Ted wave their arms,
shouting at the top of their voices, in the hope of attracting
the attention of the animal; or perhaps alarming him;
he kept doggedly on, aiming straight for the fleeing boy,
whose legs by this time seemed to wabble under him, possibly
through sheer fright.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE FINISH OF TY'S FAMOUS SWEATER.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> one of the three scouts, waiting at the fence to
assist Ty over, should he be fortunate enough to arrive
ahead of the enraged bull, held his breath with suspense.</p>

<p>They could easily see that at the rate of progress made
by their unfortunate chum, he must certainly be overtaken
before he could arrive and have a chance to clamber over
that high and stout rail fence, supposed to be bull proof.</p>

<p>But they failed to take into consideration the fact that
Ty had profited more than a little from his connection
with the scouts. And, besides, all through his exciting
race with that owner of the wicked little black horns, he
had kept in mind the last instructions shouted across the
field by Elmer, the boy who had spent a part of his life
on a cattle ranch and farm, and was supposed to know
all about the habits of the animals.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's sure a goner!" gasped Landy, as they saw the
rapidly advancing bull draw nearer and nearer the frantic
runner. "Poor old Ty; I wonder will we be able to catch
him on the fly!"</p>

<p>Landy was evidently thinking of baseball, though his
excitement was so great that he hardly knew just what
was passing through his mind.</p>

<p>"Look at that, will you?" burst from Ted.</p>

<p>Ty had waited until all hope of gaining the fence seemed
to have fled. Over his shoulder he could see his terrible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
enemy closing in and apparently putting on greater speed.
If anything was to be done it must be accomplished without
the loss of another second.</p>

<p>It was then that he suddenly drew something from the
bosom of his outing shirt. This "something" proved to
be that old red sweater which he had refused to leave in
the crotch of the friendly tree, into the branches of which
he had hurriedly climbed at the time he was first beset.</p>

<p>He waved the flaming garment wildly about his head in
order to make sure that it caught the eye of the bull;
and once that was done it might be put down as certain
that the animal would see nothing else than that hated
color.</p>

<p>"Wow! He's done it!" cried Landy, as his fat face
was pressed tight against the rails of the fence, between
which he had an uninterrupted view of the proceedings.</p>

<p>Ty had thrown the red sweater aside.</p>

<p>It floated to the ground as the slight breeze caught its
extended folds, and must have presented quite an inviting
picture to the inflamed orbs of the bull.</p>

<p>Would he stop short to pay attention to the object of
his wrath, forgetting all about the boy who was fleeing
toward safety? Elmer did not once doubt it. He knew
that this was a familiar trick among the picadors in the
arena during a Spanish bullfight; and one that seldom
fails, if properly carried out.</p>

<p>Still, he held his breath with anxiety during that brief
space of time; for if the trick did not succeed, Ty would
very likely be in for an experience that must prove exceedingly
painful, if not positively dangerous.</p>

<p>But the red sweater did not fail its owner. Long had
Ty worn that same garment proudly, in spite of jeers and
caustic comments on the part of his comrades. And if it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
were fated to meet destruction at this time, at least it
would serve a very useful purpose.</p>

<p>The animal saw the descending flag that incited his
anger. Immediately he pulled up short, and began to gore
the inoffensive article, thrusting his horns through it, while
holding it down with his forefeet at the same time. In
this way it was quickly rent into fragments, which the
triumphant bull seemed to take great delight in tossing
up into the air, as he bellowed with satisfaction.</p>

<p>And so the puffing Ty was enabled to reach the fence.
Willing hands were extended to him, and with a rush he
found himself drawn to safety.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cheered Landy. "You beat him to a frazzle,
Ty! That was as clever a little trick as I ever heard
tell of."</p>

<p>"All right," grunted the saved one, as he glared venomously
between the rails of the fence; "but would you
see what he's doing to my fine old sweater? That makes
me feel sick. Two years now I've worn that, and she was
sure good for another."</p>

<p>"But, man alive, think of what he would have done to
you only for that sweater!" exclaimed the fat boy.</p>

<p>"Vat's de madder mit you, Ty?" demanded Adam, who
looked at things without the least bit of sentiment; "you
pet my life I vould pe gladder as anydings if I pe in your
blace. Let der pull alone; he's enchoying himself. Shake
vonce on dot narrow escape. Py chimineddy! Mine heart
it vas yump in my throat yust as you throw dot sweater
avay!"</p>

<p>But Ty refused to be consoled. The sight of the animal
running around as if looking for him, with a sad portion
of the beloved sweater fastened to one of his ugly little
horns, made him grit his teeth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Huh!" he said, disdainfully. "You fellers just think
it's fine because you never did appreciate that beautiful
old sweater; but if you think you're going to get free
from seeing me look like myself, you've got another guess
coming, that's what. Say, d'ye think I'm going to let an
old one-eyed bull knock me out of wearing what I fancy?
If I feel like it I'll put on six red coats."</p>

<p>"Hath he got only one eye, Ty?" asked Ted, eagerly.</p>

<p>"That's a fact, boys; didn't I see it glaring up at me
time and again, when the sly old critter'd pretend to be
eating grass, and hoping I'd come down," Ty answered,
promptly enough.</p>

<p>"Then jutht think what might have happened to you,
my thon, if the old bull had happened to potheth <i>two</i>
eyeth," remarked Ted, soberly.</p>

<p>Ty would not even smile, he was so angry at the sacrifice
of his garment. Climbing up on the topmost rail of
the fence, he shook his fist at the prancing bull, and even
shouted all sorts of things at him.</p>

<p>"That don't wind it up, not by a long sight!" he declared.
"I know where I can get a better sweater than
that old one, and for three dollars, too. I've got that and
more in my bank at home; and the very first thing I do
when I get back will be to bust that same bank open and
go down to Selfridge's department store. Oh, have all
the fun you want with it, you one-eyed beast; but some
day perhaps I'll get even with you!"</p>

<p>"Better forget all that, Ty," remarked Elmer, coming
up at this moment. "You had ought to be so tickled over
making such a narrow escape that you'd never bother
your head over the loss of that worn-out old thing."</p>

<p>"Worn-out nothing," declared the aroused Ty. "I
could have had good use out of that sweater this fall, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
football. But never mind; I know just what I'm going to
do about it."</p>

<p>"Nothing foolish, I hope," observed the patrol leader,
as he cast an apprehensive glance toward the bull.</p>

<p>"Buy that other red sweater that's hung in the window
of our big store this month and more. Perhaps, after all,
I may not be so sorry, because it's much brighter than that
old one; and some of the boys will let out a howl when
they first see me in it."</p>

<p>Ty actually allowed a grin to appear on his face at the
thought of this; which would apparently indicate that his
anger was not so very deep after all.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," continued Elmer, "I want to tell you, Ty,
old fellow, that you did that little trick as fine as silk!"</p>

<p>"D'ye think so, Elmer?" remarked the other, looking
pleased; for what boy does not like the appreciation of his
fellows?</p>

<p>"You certainly did. I've seen cowboys go through with
that act many a time, but never any better than you did
it," Elmer went on to say. "The only thing I was afraid
of was, you might throw it in such a doubled-up way that
it would not catch the eye of the bull. But you shook
it out all right; and once he saw it he could look at nothing
else after that."</p>

<p>"Say, I did that on purpose, sure I did, Elmer," declared
Ty, eagerly. "Seemed to me that it was the proper
caper to try. And she worked all right, too. But look
here, fellows, he put his horns through that blessed old
tin milk pail the farmer's women folks loaned us. She's
a wreck; and anyhow we couldn't get in there by the tree
to pick it up. What's to be done about it, tell me that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there's only one thing to be done," laughed
Elmer, taking out half a dollar and thrusting it into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
hand of Ty. "We've just got to pay for the lost pail
and borrow another one. That's part of the funds we
raised before starting out. Are you still going to get
that milk, Ty?"</p>

<p>"Am I? Say, twenty bulls couldn't stop me, once I
start on a thing. Milk we want for our breakfast, and
milk we're going to have, you mark me," said Ty, stubbornly.</p>

<p>"Shake on that!" laughed Landy.</p>

<p>"Oxcuse me, off you blease," spoke up Adam with a
sly grin; "put is dot vat you galls a milk-shake?"</p>

<p>Elmer laughed, and at the same time looked suspiciously
at the German; for somehow he was fast coming
to the conclusion that Adam might be smarter than his
stolid appearance indicated. In fact, he believed that the
German often put on an air of extreme innocence when in
fact he was enjoying a sly little joke.</p>

<p>"He'll bear watching," was what Elmer said to himself,
as he heard the other laughing uproariously at his own
humor, while squeezing the hands of his new chums.</p>

<p>"But, Ty," the patrol leader remarked, with a twinkle
in his own eye, "you've learned one thing, I think."</p>

<p>"Sure. Always to see that there's a tree in a field
before trying to cross over," said the other, quickly.</p>

<p>"Well, that's a good motto, I suppose," remarked
Elmer; "but that wasn't what I meant. You know now
that many times the longest way around is the shortest
way to the fire. After this you'll think twice before taking
a short cut."</p>

<p>"I'll squint around for anything in the shape of a bull,
anyway," chuckled Ty.</p>

<p>The animal had succeeded in demolishing the offensive
garment by this time, and as if to show his utter contempt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
for the whole bunch of boys, he started to crop the short,
sweet grass where he happened to be standing. Whenever
he came upon a tattered fragment of the illy treated
sweater, he would give it a toss, utter a defiant bellow,
paw the ground a little, and then calmly resume his
feeding.</p>

<p>But doubtless all the while he was watching the boys
beyond the fence out of a corner of his eye. Elmer knew
that this must be so, for he noticed that the animal always
kept his head turned toward them.</p>

<p>"He vas as mad as some hornets," remarked Adam,
who seemed to be particularly interested in the actions of
the bull, for he kept peering through the fence. "Aber
I haf a red sweater I vould see if he likes to yump at me.
Oxcuse me, Elmer, put let me haf de loan off dis."</p>

<p>He deftly took the bandana handkerchief from the hands
of the patrol leader, as Elmer was about to fasten it once
more around his own neck; for he had used it to attract
the attention of the bull, it may be remembered, when at
the other side of the field; and events had followed so
rapidly since, that he had not found a chance to replace
the handkerchief where it belonged.</p>

<p>"Hold on, no foolish business, Adam!" cried Elmer,
clutching a leg of the German as he started to mount the
fence.</p>

<p>"Nein! I haf no vish to get me a grafeyard in kevick,"
Adam declared. "Only I vould like to see if dot pad
egg oudt in der field vould run at me like he dood at Ty.
You pet my life I vill not yump <i>inside</i> de fence; and dot's
no choke, Elmer."</p>

<p>Accordingly, Elmer released his clutch, and the stout
German climbed nimbly to the top of the fence. Here he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
began to wave the handkerchief in the most brazen manner,
at the same time calling out defiantly at the animal.</p>

<p>At first the bull refused to listen, but kept on grazing;
though doubtless the sight of the hated color was working
upon him.</p>

<p>"See him edging this way, would you, the sly old sinner!"
called Landy.</p>

<p>"He's getting ready for a rush," remarked Elmer.</p>

<p>"Look out, Adam; be ready to drop off there!" cried
Landy.</p>

<p>"And be thure not to take the wrong thide, or you'll
be in for it!" admonished Ted, a little nervously.</p>

<p>Suddenly the beast threw off the mask, so to speak. He
made a plunge, and was immediately in motion, coming
with lowered head on the full run, and heading for the
spot where Adam stood on the fence flaunting that flag
of defiance.</p>

<p>"He's off!" yelled Landy. "Jump, Adam, before he
knocks you into the field! Oh, ain't he just the limit,
though; and as mad as they make 'em! Jump, why don't
you? Elmer make him come down! Perhaps he's got his
foot caught, and can't drop out!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A DOUBLE-ACTION JOKE.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Jump</span>, Adam!" called Elmer.</p>

<p>The German had waited as long as he dared, and as if
the voice of the patrol leader gave him the sign, he suddenly
made a backward spring, turned a somersault in the
air, just as he had done from the springboard when swimming,
and landed squarely on his feet.</p>

<p>Crash!</p>

<p>That was the bull striking head-on against the fence.
And it was fortunate for the other boys, as well as Adam,
perhaps, that the owner of the bull had made that fence
additionally strong. Had it given way before the onslaught
of the animal the chances were Elmer and his mates would
have had to do some lively running to get clear.</p>

<p>But the fence held, though it wabbled suspiciously, and
Elmer felt sure that a few more such blows must have demolished
the barrier completely.</p>

<p>"Don't you wish you could, old fellow?" taunted
Landy, after he had made sure of the fact that the animal
was going to be held back.</p>

<p>The bull looked through the fence, snorted, pawed the
earth, and let out an angry bellow. Then he walked disdainfully
away, as though satisfied with the victory he had
gained, that one fragment of the torn red sweater still
floating from his horn, just for all the world, as Ty remarked,
"like a flag at half mast."</p>

<p>"Come, let's hike back to camp, boys," remarked Elmer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
moving off, "and finish getting our breakfast ready. By
the time Ty manages to come along we'll be fixed for business."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll show up in decent shape, all right," remarked
the other. "This time I'll take no rash chances in crossing
fields. Around the fence is good enough for me, I guess."</p>

<p>He was as prompt as his word, and came along with his
pail of fresh milk just as Elmer was beating the tattoo on
the frying pan that summoned the party to breakfast.</p>

<p>"What did they say up at the farmer's, Ty!" asked
Landy.</p>

<p>"Not guilty," replied the other, who was cramming his
mouth with a portion of the flapjacks Elmer had made, and
which were really fine.</p>

<p>"Now, what's the use of giving us puzzles to solve!"
complained the fat boy, as he speared his second helping
from the tin platter, and proceeded to deluge the same with
some maple syrup that had been brought along in a bottle.
"Not guilty of what, say!"</p>

<p>"That ain't their bull, you see," remarked Ty.</p>

<p>"And tho they declined to buy you a new thweater, ith
that it, Ty?" asked Ted, a little maliciously.</p>

<p>"Oh, rats!" cried the other; "you know right well I'm
not built that way, Ted Burgoyne. Never once thought of
trying to make anybody pay for my foolishness in trying
to cut across a field that had a bull in it. I only mentioned
the fact because, you see, I had to explain what happened
to their tin bucket, when I was paying for it. But after all
they wouldn't accept the money&mdash;said it was only an old
pail after all, and the farmer he told me I ought to be glad
it was the bull, and not me, that kicked the bucket."</p>

<p>"Bully for the farmer!" said Landy, or at least that
was what the others took it for granted he meant, since his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
mouth was so full of flapjack that he could hardly do more
than mutter.</p>

<p>After breakfast was over they started to carry out the
various duties or pleasures which each fellow had in view.
One wanted to take a few pictures, and, of course, this was
Landy, though his mates solemnly warned him to be careful
what vines he touched while in the woods. Another declared
he felt like trying to tempt some of the finny denizens
of the river from their beds on this bright morning. This
was Adam, and he had brought along a lot of new tackle,
as well as a fine jointed rod, to prove that he was as good
a fisherman as he was a water dog.</p>

<p>Elmer chose to potter around the camp. There were always
plenty of things that could be done to improve conditions
and add to the general comfort of those who occupied
the tent and cooked at the fireplace made of stones.
And having the true sportsman spirit in his composition,
he was never more happy than when arranging these many
little details connected with the camp.</p>

<p>He improved the fireplace so that the coffee pot would
not tilt and threaten to upset from the three metal crossbars
that formed a gridiron; he dug the drain at the back of
the tent a little deeper, so that in case of a sudden heavy
downpour the surplus water would be carried off and not
inundate the tent, and, finally, he finished the rude but
effective table on which they could place their food at
meal times, and even had a couple of short sections of log
rolled up so as to take the place of seats when they dined.</p>

<p>Ty, after the breakfast things had been washed up and
put away, wandered off somewhere. And Ted was supposed
to be fishing farther down the stream, he, too, having
expressed a wish for a real fish dinner that night, if so
be the bass in the Sweetwater were in a "taking" humor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Several times when Elmer stood up to rest the muscles
of his back, and consider what he would do next, he happened
to cast a curious look up to where Adam had taken
his position on the bank of the river.</p>

<p>Apparently the fish did not respond to the urgent invitations
of the German boy as well as he had expected,
or else Adam's education with regard to the ways the
American black bass has to be attracted to the bait had
been neglected.</p>

<p>For some time he was industriously seen threshing the
water as though issuing a call to all the fish in the river
to come and have a bite with him. Of course that was just
the opposite of what he should have done; for bass are
shy and have to be tempted in quietness.</p>

<p>Elmer chuckled to himself when first he noticed what the
new scout was doing.</p>

<p>"Looks like Adam is densely ignorant along our ways
of fishing," he thought. "Wonder now what kind of fish
he's ever caught that style on the other side of the ocean.
Perhaps he never wet a line before in all his life. I noticed
that he watched Ted closely, and imitated him exactly in
setting up his line, even to the float Ted always persists in
using."</p>

<p>The third time Elmer looked it was perhaps an hour
after Adam had started fishing, and he saw that a change
had come over the manner of the young Teuton. He was
no longer casting out again and again with a great splashing
of the water. On the contrary, he sat astride the tree
trunk that jutted out some eight feet above the water.
His line ran downstream and the float could be seen bobbing
in the midst of the little bubbles that marked an
eddy below.</p>

<p>Elmer watched him closely for five minutes, and not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
once in all that time did he see the other move in the
least.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare, I believe the fellow's gone to sleep!"
he laughed. "I reckon Adam isn't used to camping out,
and on that account he's had poor rest these two nights.
And that hot sun is enough to make any fellow feel drowsy,
too. Whew, what if he nodded too hard and just dropped
off there! Perhaps I'd better go and wake him up. And
while I'm about it I can just give him a few pointers as to
how he'll have at least a decent chance to coax a few bass
to his bait."</p>

<p>Filled with this feeling of comradery toward the new
recruit, whom he was fast learning to like because of his
constant good-nature and really witty remarks, Elmer
started away from the camp.</p>

<p>It just chanced that instead of heading directly for
Adam, he walked first of all out to the river bank. Looking
downstream he could just see Ted busily engaged in
landing a fish that seemed to be fighting hard, and this told
that the bass were "on the feed," if only one knew how
to attract them.</p>

<p>The idea of that sleepy Adam dozing there and letting
the golden harvest time slip by unheeded made Elmer
laugh again. He even allowed himself to imagine that it
would just about pay Adam right if he crept up and gave
his line a sudden tug, to make him think he had a bite.</p>

<p>Just then something moving attracted his attention. It
was directly below the boy who sat astraddle of the projecting
log, and a little farther downstream.</p>

<p>Ty, why of course it was that party, though minus his
distinguishing red sweater, which was now, alas, no more.
But what under the sun was he doing there? As near as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Elmer could see he appeared to be industriously attaching
some bulky object to the end of a line!</p>

<p>All at once what seemed to be the truth burst upon the
patrol leader. Ty had also noticed the sleeping Dutchman,
and was bent upon having a little joke at the expense of
Adam. Yes, he had managed to draw the line of the fisherman
in, by the aid of a long stick that had a crotch at the
end, and was now fastening a bunch of hemlock browse,
done up to represent a big fish, to the end of the same.</p>

<p>When all was ready and the current pulled strongly at
the bulky object, possibly the additional strain might
arouse Adam, who would immediately think he had hooked
a monster bass, and doubtless the ensuing excitement would
tickle the joker to the top of his bent.</p>

<p>And if Adam did not wake up himself, it would be easy
for Ty to creep under the projecting log until he could
reach out and give the line a jerk.</p>

<p>So Elmer concluded that he might as well wait and see
the fun. Being a boy himself, he liked anything that partook
of clean sport, so long as the joke did not border along
the cruel or mean stage.</p>

<p>Now Ty had dropped his artificial fish back into the river.
The swift current that ran farther out did not seize upon
it at once, for there was an eddy and a rather deep pool at
the spot Adam had selected for his fishing. Consequently
the pull upon the line did not seem to come up to the expectations
of the joker.</p>

<p>Ty crouched there waiting for results.</p>

<p>The minutes passed and all remained peaceful and serene.
Adam seemed to be enjoying a lovely sleep. His head was
upon his chest and his whole figure appeared to be in a
relaxed state.</p>

<p>Twice did Ty rise up to stare at the boy who sat there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
straddling that log, as though he wondered why Adam did
not arouse to the occasion. Plainly, the practical joker
would have had his labor for his pains unless something
was done to start things moving.</p>

<p>The third time Ty seemed to come to this conclusion himself,
for instead of merely observing the sleeping fisherman
he started to advance toward him.</p>

<p>At this point the bank of the river was hollowed out somewhat.
There was just about enough footing below for an
agile boy to clamber along and keep from being precipitated
into the water.</p>

<p>Elmer chuckled quietly.</p>

<p>"It's coming," he said to himself, as he prepared to see
more or less excitement around that region. "Looks like
Adam might be due to a little surprise party."</p>

<p>Ty had finally managed to crawl far enough along the
narrow ledge. He was apparently directly below the log
that stuck out from the bank above him. Elmer judged
this by the way the other craned his neck in order to look
up.</p>

<p>"Now he's got his chance, if he can only reach that
dangling line!" he thought.</p>

<p>Apparently Ty realized the same thing, for he was seen
to be extending that same crotched stick that had before
proven so useful.</p>

<p>In this fashion he speedily drew the line in toward him,
gently, so as not to arouse the fisherman before he was
ready to give him a good hard shock.</p>

<p>"Pull up the curtain, the stage is all ready!" Elmer
said to himself, as he kept close watch on the movements of
the boy below.</p>

<p>He could see Ty taking a firm grip on the dangling line
as though he meant to have it no halfway affair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, go!" exclaimed the watcher.</p>

<p>Just as though Ty might have been waiting for some
such order, he was seen to suddenly tighten his hold, and
then give a tremendous jerk, that was surely calculated to
make Adam believe the champion bass of the Sweetwater
had taken his bait and gorged it.</p>

<p>Then something happened, something that doubtless the
practical joker crouching below had not anticipated as a
result of his prank.</p>

<p>Adam seemed to suddenly awaken. He was evidently
greatly excited, and as he made a wild clutch at the butt
of his rod, which had been partly jerked out of his grasp
by the violence of that bite, he just naturally lost his seat
on the log.</p>

<p>Elmer saw him gracefully slide around the trunk of the
fallen tree and go down with arms and legs sprawled out
like an immense frog. And, strange to say, as he dropped
his extended arms seemed to suddenly clasp Ty in their embrace,
for both of them went headlong into the river with
a tremendous splash!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>STRANGE SOUNDS FROM THE WATER.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Adam</span> did that on purpose!" was what Elmer exclaimed,
as he saw how the arms of the falling German
boy pulled Ty with him into the pool under the log.</p>

<p>That great splash was surely enough to frighten away
any bass that might even have had the hardihood to remain
around, after the vigorous threshing of the water by the
greenhorn fisherman.</p>

<p>Of course the two boys immediately came to the surface.
Ty was spouting water like a young whale; but Adam
seemed to be all right. He made a few strokes after his
original fashion, that had so aroused the admiration of
Landy, and arriving at the bank, climbed up.</p>

<p>Ty made a great deal more fuss as he churned his
way to the shore; and Elmer, who had hastened up so
as to witness what followed, could see that there was a
look of wonder, almost awe, on the face of the practical
joker. The results had been so sudden, and so disastrous
to himself, that he could hardly understand just what had
happened.</p>

<p>"Ach! put dot vas sooch a surprises to me, Ty," remarked
Adam, from the shore; "I dinks me I haf ketch
de biggest fish in der river; undt ven I throw oudt mine
arms to pull him in, py chinks, it vas only you, having
some fun py me. How goes it, londsman; I hopes you
enchoy yourself mooch. Subbose you go pack, undt get
my fishing pole, vich is floating down der stream."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>He gave Ty a push as the other tried to clamber out
on the bank and forced him in again. The other showed
signs of fight until Elmer, sizing up the situation, called
out:</p>

<p>"That's only fair, Ty; you made him lose his rod, as
well as take a ducking with his clothes on. Get the rod
again, and let him pull in his fish."</p>

<p>Possibly Ty realized the justice of this claim; or it
might be he felt disposed to take his medicine gracefully,
for with a laugh he swam out again, as well as he was
able with his garments clinging to his limbs, secured the
rod, which had partly sunk, and came back with it in one
hand.</p>

<p>As if to prove that he harbored no animosity, Adam
frankly stretched out his hand and helped Ty ashore.
There they stood, dripping wet, and laughing at each
other.</p>

<p>"Oxcuse me, Ty," said the German lad, making a queer
face; "put I haf to laugh, it is so funny! You dinks to
make me some droubles, and by shiminy you fall indo de
same hole yourself. So, dere is two of us!"</p>

<p>"The joke is on Ty," announced Elmer. "I saw the
whole thing, and I want Adam to own up right now that
he had one eye open all the while, and was watching what
was going on."</p>

<p>Adam looked up at him with a leer on his square face;
then he shut one eye and deliberately winked at Elmer.</p>

<p>"I subbose dot I vas nodt so much asleep as somepody
pelieves," he said; and that was the only confession they
could get out of him.</p>

<p>Fortunately, as the weather was so very warm, there
was no danger of either of the boys taking cold after their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
ducking. Neither of them would bother changing their
garments, or attempting to dry those they had on.</p>

<p>"Let 'em dry on me," said Ty, whose good-nature had
returned, though he declared that everything had conspired
to upset all his calculations that morning; what with
the obstinate bull, and now the clumsy Dutchman who
had to throw out his arm and pull him into the river along
with himself.</p>

<p>Ted had come up from his fishing place below to ask
what all the row was about.</p>

<p>"Fact ith, you have buthted up the fithing for thith
morning," he declared, with some show of indignation.
"If you mutht kick up a racket, why under the thun don't
you go off by yourthelf and do it. I got theven fith, and
one of 'em a beaut. And the biggetht of the bunch wath
jutht going to take hold when you had to make all that
beathtly row."</p>

<p>When, however, the thing was explained to him, Ted
enjoyed the joke as well as Elmer had. He declared that
he would wander along down the river to another promising
hole he remembered seeing. And Elmer, thinking that
the German boy might as well begin taking some lessons
in bass fishing, agreed to accompany Adam upstream a
little distance, to try for a capture.</p>

<p>"Hey, that was just the greatest thing ever!" called
out a voice; and Landy was seen approaching from above,
waving his little kodak in glee.</p>

<p>"What's all this talk about?" demanded Ty.</p>

<p>"I got it, that's what!" the fat boy kept on saying.
"And won't it just be a corker, though!"</p>

<p>Elmer jumped to conclusions at this remark.</p>

<p>"Do you mean you saw the tumble Adam and Ty
took?" he asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," Landy went on, "you see, I had just discovered
Adam sitting there asleep on that log sticking out over
the water; and I thought what a lovely subject he would
make for a picture. So I crept up till I had a good focus,
and then I pressed the button!"</p>

<p>"Yes, go on; that wasn't all you did, was it?" asked
the patrol leader, who was able to read the open-faced
Landy like the page of a book.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, it was such a fine subject that I thought
I had ought to knock off another view, so that if one proved
poor the other might be good. And just as I was all ready,
why, it happened!"</p>

<p>"And you snapped it off as they were falling in?"
Elmer continued.</p>

<p>"I think I did," said Landy, eagerly; "for my finger
just pressed the trigger unconsciously. I was that astonished,
you see. And I'm going to develop this roll to-night.
Wouldn't it be just immense if it turned out to be a good
picture!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; something to amuse the rest of the troop,
and chase the blues away," grunted Ty, as he hunched his
shoulders and sauntered back to the camp to ascertain
what Elmer might have been doing there.</p>

<p>Elmer did take Adam up the river a piece, and finding
a promising spot where there seemed to be a likelihood of
bass frequenting, he proceeded to instruct the other in the
rudiments of the art.</p>

<p>Adam took to it from the very first. He was frank
enough to confess that he had never done any fishing in
the old country, and was therefore utterly green; but he
showed an aptitude for catching on to what Elmer told
him; and before they had been an hour at work he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
not only succeeded in hooking a fine specimen of the gamey
bass, but played and landed him in great style.</p>

<p>"You'll do, I reckon, now, Adam; so I'll leave you here
and go back to camp. Be sure you come in when you hear
the signal, which will be three loud cooies."</p>

<p>At noon, when the fishermen gave it up for the day, as
the heat stopped all biting on the part of the bass, it was
found that while Ted had caught seven fair-sized fish,
five of them bass, one a large perch, and a sucker that was
the largest Elmer had ever seen around that region, Adam
had brought in two bass and a big catfish.</p>

<p>"Py shiminy crickets, dot feller vas dry some foolishness
py me," he said, as he held up the still wriggling
catfish; "I haf drouples to get him off der hook; and he
sthick me dwice so hardt in der finger. Ooch! put it do
feel sore yet somedimes. I dink me he preak off some
dot thorn in der pone."</p>

<p>"That's another lesson you must learn, Adam," said
Elmer. "The catfish has ugly spines that hurt like fun
when you run your hand against them. I guess they're
poisoned, like the tail of the stingy-ray, down South. I've
known a fellow who had a running sore for a month after
being stuck by the fin of a cat. And, Ted, seems to me
here's another chance to use that colored stuff that was
so fine with Landy."</p>

<p>"Right-o, Elmer," exclaimed the other, making a dive
for the tent to look up his medicine bag.</p>

<p>So Adam grinned, and allowed the "doctor" to paint
his hand in the region where the spines of the catfish had
penetrated with such painful results. Indeed, he declared
an hour later that the pain had all departed; and Elmer
concluded from this that permanganate of potash was good
to use on all sorts of poison wounds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe," he went on to say, "that if I was struck
on the arm by a rattler, I'd cut the wound open some,
suck all the poison I could out, providing I had no scratch
or sore about my mouth, and then take my chances, after
painting it freely with the strongest solution of this potash
I could bear. Yes, and I think I'd come out much better
than those who believe in soaking the patient with
whisky."</p>

<p>The afternoon they spent in resting up. Indeed, it was
unusually hot, and somehow none of them aspired to exert
themselves any more than they could help.</p>

<p>Adam had offered to clean the fish, after he had been
shown how, and made quite a good job of it, being very
particular, after the fashion of his kind. And Elmer
gave Ty the duty of seeing that the fish were served that
evening at supper. It would be a poor piece of business
if they put several days in up there on the old Sweetwater,
famous for its bass fishing, and never once enjoy a mess
of the delicious dish.</p>

<p>They waited later than usual that evening, hoping the
air would cool off some with the setting of the sun. It
was almost dark when Ty got started with the supper.
When the fish began to fry in the pan (in which the cook
had first tried out several slices of salt pork, which grease
was made very hot before the bass, dipped in cracker-dust,
were placed in the pan), some of the boys, who had declared
they had no appetite, were observed to sit up and
take notice as they sniffed the fragrant odors that arose.</p>

<p>"Guess you-all will come around when things are
ready," laughed Ty, who often liked to mock the Southern
scout, Chatz Maxfield, when he talked.</p>

<p>"Well, I confeth I'm waking up," admitted Ted,
frankly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"And that stuff smells mighty good, Ty," declared
Landy. "I want you to remember now that it wasn't
me said I couldn't eat a bite."</p>

<p>"I thould thay not," laughed Ted. "Nobody would
ever believe you guilty of thuch a thilly thing. You're alwayth
hungry, Landy, and ready to gobble."</p>

<p>"Say, now, that's what I call mean," expostulated the
fat boy, pretending to be very indignant, though these
attacks on his character were of daily, almost hourly occurrence,
and he was quite accustomed to meeting them.
"Just because I'm big, and need more to keep me up than
the rest of you, some fellows like to say I'm greedy.
'Tain't so. And some day I'll run you a match, Ty, to
see who can keep from eating a bite the longest."</p>

<p>"Not much, you will," declared the cook. "Why, it
wouldn't be a square deal. You've got all your fat to fall
back on; and look at me, skin and bones."</p>

<p>So they laughed and talked, as the preparations for supper
went on apace.</p>

<p>"What're you listening to, Elmer?" asked Landy, after
some time had passed; and looking toward the patrol leader
he saw that he had his head raised in an attitude that
told of suddenly aroused interest.</p>

<p>"I thought I heard a queer plunk just then, out there
on the river," replied the other. "Yes, there it went
again. Did you hear it, boys?"</p>

<p>"Sure we did," replied Ty, raising his head from his
duties at the cooking fire, in between the stones that had
been fashioned somewhat after the shape of a V, with
the evening air fanning the broad end.</p>

<p>"Whatever can it be, Elmer?" demanded Landy, his
face immediately expressing curiosity, and, perhaps, a trace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of alarm; for anything that savored of mystery always excited
the fat boy.</p>

<p>All of them were now interested, and listened to ascertain
whether that strange sound was repeated. Perhaps
an interval of half a minute passed. Then once more came
that plain "plunk!"</p>

<p>"Sounds like somebody drowning, and givin' the last
gasp!" declared Ty.</p>

<p>"Oh, let up on that thort of thuff, Ty," said Ted.
"You're alwayth thinking about thuch nathty thingth."</p>

<p>Landy turned appealingly to the patrol leader. He realized
that if anybody ought to know what the character
of those queer sounds was, Elmer must.</p>

<p>"What is it, Elmer?" he asked again. "The sea serpent
or only some old grand-daddy bullfrog croaking to
himself on a log. Say, perhaps that's one of them funny
old loon birds you were telling us about to-day, that can
just laugh so's to make your flesh creep! Tell us about
that, Elmer. Whatever is it? There, that time it was a
double plunkety-plunk! Now, I wonder what in the
dickens it means!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE NEWS THAT GEORGE BROUGHT.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Elmer</span> laughed.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said, "and you'll hear some more of the
same kind."</p>

<p>Hardly had he ceased speaking than there was another
loud "chug" heard.</p>

<p>"My, he jumped into the water that time, sure, if it
<i>was</i> a frog!" said Landy.</p>

<p>Then came a strange rattling sound, as of half a dozen
"plunks" all mixed up.</p>

<p>"He threw a handful then for a change, and good
measure," remarked Elmer, dryly.</p>

<p>"A handful of what?" echoed Ty.</p>

<p>"Stones!" replied the patrol leader.</p>

<p>The others stared at each other.</p>

<p>"Is <i>that</i> what it is, then?" asked Landy, heaving a
distinct sigh of relief. "Why, of course, we all ought to
have got on to it before now. Stones always make that
kind of plunk when they drop into the water from above.
But, Elmer, whoever d'ye think it can be; and what's he
trying to do&mdash;scare us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that remains to be seen. Suppose you fellows go
on getting supper ready, while I slip out quietly and investigate,"
Elmer proposed.</p>

<p>"Don't take too many chances, remember, Elmer," cautioned
Ty, as he turned again to his frying pan, filled with
fish.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yeth, go thlow, Elmer," said Ted, shaking his head.
"You know there'th a bad lot of fellowth over in Fairfield,
alwayth ready to play trickth on travelerth. It may be they
only want to coax one of our crowd out, and then carry
him off. Take a club along with you, Elmer."</p>

<p>"Yes, do," Landy added, thrusting a stout stick into
the hand of the patrol leader. "And use it if you have
to. Remember, one call of the wolf will bring us along
in a rush, Elmer. And I'm going to have some other
nice clubs handy, in a minute or two."</p>

<p>"Don't go to any trouble, because you may be disappointed,"
chuckled Elmer, as he pushed back into the
shadows, so that he could enter the tent.</p>

<p>Having done this, two minutes later he was crawling out
from under the canvas at the back of the tent, having
unfastened the same by uprooting the peg at that particular
spot.</p>

<p>Of course it was easy enough for Elmer to creep away
undetected by anyone who might be in a position to watch
the camp. His experience on the plains of the new country
up beyond the Saskatchewan River in Canada, where his
father had been in charge of a relative's ranch and farm,
was of considerable benefit to him now.</p>

<p>Once free from the light of the fire, Elmer stopped to
listen and made up his mind concerning certain things.
Then he again pushed forward.</p>

<p>He was now making something in the shape of a half
circuit. If he kept on long enough he would presently
bring up on the river bank below the camp; and this was
in reality his destination; for he believed that the unknown
party who was tossing those stones out into the river, with
the intention of mystifying them, must be stationed somewhere
there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>In fact, Elmer had remembered that just here the shore
made a sort of little beach, which they could have used
nicely as a landing place, had they possessed a boat. And
he had also noted the fact that there was a great abundance
of round stones there, very tempting to the average boy,
who loves to hurl such things into the water, just to see
them splash.</p>

<p>He was drawing near this particular spot now, and in
order to avoid being seen, as his figure would be outlined
against the sky, he dropped down on his hands and knees,
crawling forward the last ten feet after this Indian fashion.</p>

<p>The darkness was not intense, and Elmer had a pair of
unusually keen eyes. Hence, as he stopped there just
above the little beach, he was able to make out a figure
that seemed to be bent over as if searching for something.</p>

<p>"He's hunting another relay of stones," thought Elmer,
wondering who the party could be.</p>

<p>There was a slight possibility that it might turn out to
be some wandering hobo, who thought he might cause the
boys to temporarily abandon that fine supper, which he
could snatch up and make away with. Then, again, there
was a chance of this fellow being only one of a number of
the Fairfield roughs, who, having discovered their camp,
were bound to do all they could to make trouble.</p>

<p>But Elmer did not take much stock in either of these
theories. He was inclined to look upon the unknown as
a friend, one of the fellows from Hickory Ridge, who had
come out to join them for the last day of their stay on the
Sweetwater.</p>

<p>That was why he listened so keenly, for he hoped to catch
some familiar sound calculated to tell the identity of the
dusky figure below.</p>

<p>The drone of voices from around the fire came to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
ears, telling that his four chums had taken his advice,
and were acting as though they had no particular interest
in those queer noises.</p>

<p>Now the figure below seemed to straighten up, and Elmer
knew he meant to throw another stone, perhaps a second
volley that would rattle like shot as they came down on
the surface of the running water.</p>

<p>And as he heaved them forth, the party below gave vent
to a peculiar little grunt or wheeze that was very familiar
to the ears of Elmer Chenowith.</p>

<p>"Hello, there, George! Having a great time, I see,
amusing yourself!" he said, in a low, but plainly heard
tone.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, as though the unknown
was somewhat taken aback by the fact of his having been
caught so neatly, even in the act.</p>

<p>"That you, Elmer?" he asked, with a short laugh.</p>

<p>"That's who it is, George," the other replied. "Suppose
you come up out of that, now, and surrender. There's
a penalty attached to this thing of trying to scare us.
Do you know what you've got to do now to make good?"</p>

<p>"No, what's that, Elmer?" asked the boy, who was
climbing up the bank by now, and who happened to be a
cousin to Landy Smith, known among his mates as
"Doubting George," simply because he could not help appearing
skeptical about nearly everything that came along.</p>

<p>"Why," observed Elmer, very seriously, "you've just
got to unfasten your belt, sit down alongside us, and do
your level best to get away with a share of the fine fish
supper the boys have ready."</p>

<p>"Oh, ginger! Count me in on that, won't you?"
laughed the other, as he accepted the extended hand of
the patrol leader, and was assisted up the bank. "It's a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
long walk up here, and you see, since you fellows hiked
it, I just didn't dare use my wheel. And I tell you I'm
hungry enough to eat anything halfway decent."</p>

<p>"Well, Ty's chief cook and bottle-washer to-night; and
you know enough about him to understand what that
means. Ty's long <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'suite'">suit</ins> is his cooking. He's just the boss
at that, every day," and Elmer purposely elevated his
voice as he said this, so that those by the fire, now awaiting
them, could overhear what he said.</p>

<p>"Hey! what's all that you're saying; and who're you
talking to, Elmer?" demanded the party in question.</p>

<p>Landy gave a shout.</p>

<p>"By the great horn spoon, if it ain't my cousin
George!" he exclaimed. "Ten to one he doubted whether
we had really come up here at all&mdash;that he didn't believe
he could ever find us&mdash;that he expected to frighten the
whole bunch out of their seven senses by that silly trick;
and even now he isn't sure whether he sees us or is dreaming
he does. In fact, George can find a loophole to doubt
anything."</p>

<p>"All right, say what you want," replied the newcomer,
sturdily. "I admit that I was born with an unfortunate
disposition to question everything. Mother says I must be
a great lawyer some day. But there are some things that
are so plain even Doubting George can't miss hitting 'em.
That smell, now, is sure the finest thing that ever came
down the pike; and, anyhow, I don't doubt but that you
fellows are going to ask me to share in the grub with you.
How's that, Cousin Philander?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you're welcome to it," replied Ty, in place of
Landy. "Plenty for all; and we owe this treat to the
patience of Ted and Adam here. Later on you must get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
our new scout to tell you how he goes in after his fish,
clothes and all. It's a real funny stunt, George."</p>

<p>"Yeth," put in Ted. "And mind you, he pullth in
other fellowth with him. Be thure to have him tell you
that part, my thon. It'th worth hearing, George."</p>

<p>Of course, around the fire, as they discussed the qualities
of the fish, the story was told. Everyone seemed to have
a share in the telling, so that George got it from several
sources.</p>

<p>"And pretty soon," declared Landy, "I'm going to
use a black pocket in the woods close by as my dark room,
so I can develop that roll of films. You see, I'm just
wild to learn whether I really did push that trigger on
the camera, and shoot it off, just as those two fellows were
tumbling into the water. If I got that, it'll pay me for
the whole job of hiking away up here and losing more'n
a pound in weight."</p>

<p>"Wish you luck, then, Philander," said George, who
usually made a mouthful of his cousin's name.</p>

<p>Some people said George was really envious of Landy's
possessing such an uncommon name; others believed that
he was proud of being connected with a family that could
sport such a classical "cognomen," as he often termed it.</p>

<p>"When did you leave good old Hickory Ridge?" asked
Ty; for, like most boys, no sooner was Ty away from home
than everything about the place assumed an almost sacred
aspect, and he could never even mention its name without
an affectionate prefix of some sort.</p>

<p>"I reckon I've been three hours on the way," was
George's reply.</p>

<p>"Three hours to get up here! Say, you didn't walk like
that in the big hike, when you covered the name of Robbins
with imperishable glory," Landy declared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shucks, and me the lowest score in the whole bunch!"
sneered George. "But I guess I lost the way, and covered
a lot more territory than I ought to have done."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Landy, "I know what was the matter.
You just made up your mind every signpost lied, and
when it said go east, you tried the other road. That's
what you get for doubting everything. It brings heaps
of trouble, and if you're wise you'll shunt that on to the
side track in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks! Attend to your own mutton, Landy,"
said George; but his face had reddened at the accusation
of his cousin, and none of the others doubted but that
Landy's random shot had hit pretty close to the truth.</p>

<p>"Anything new around Hickory Ridge since we left
there?" asked Elmer.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, there is, fellows," replied George, brightening
up, as though he had just thought of something.</p>

<p>"Then tell us what it is. Has Hiram Juggles got a
new shingle on his barn; or did the Mosely twins get mixed
up again, so that nobody knows which is Jim and which
Jack?" asked Ty.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's something more serious than that, let me tell
you," George went on, with a vein of mystery in his voice
that instantly aroused the curiosity of Landy.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you tell us what it is, George, you old
ice wagon!" he exclaimed. "Somebody give him a push,
please, and get him to roll his hoop."</p>

<p>"They tried to wreck the midnight express&mdash;guess you
fellows started off too early in the mornin' to hear about
it," George said.</p>

<p>"We never heard a word, so hurry up and tell us,
George," said Elmer.</p>

<p>"Yes, whatever in the wide world would they want to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
wreck that train for? Was it some crazy man; or do they
think it could have been an attempt to rob the express
safe?" demanded Ty, anxiously; for he had an uncle who
held the throttle of the engine pulling that particular
train, and was therefore deeply interested.</p>

<p>"Nobody's dead sure what they wanted to do," George
went on, "but the messenger admits that he was carrying
a bigger amount of money than usual. Perhaps the hoboes
got wind of it, and thought they might have a chance to
capture the stuff. They didn't have nerve enough to hold
the train up in western fashion, so they tried the coward
play."</p>

<p>"I notice that you say hoboes did it, as if nobody
doubted that part of the affair," Elmer remarked, significantly.</p>

<p>"They were seen by a track walker, and had quite a
fight with him," George continued. "The poor chap is
in the hospital now, though he's going to pull through.
He managed to crawl to a station and give the alarm, so
no damage was done. And now they're hunting high and
low for two hoboes, one short with red hair, and t'other
a long-legged fellow who limps when he walks, like he'd
once had his leg hurt. They are called Shorty and Lanky
Jim!"</p>

<p>It was Adam who set up a shout that caused the others
to stare at him.</p>

<p>"Hey, what's this mean?" demanded Ty. "He looks
like he knew something about the two rascals you were
telling us about, George. Elmer, you take him in hand,
won't you, and see what he's got on his mind. And make
him tell it in plain United States. We left our Dutch dictionaries
at home this trip, you see."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>UNDER THE TWINKLING STARS.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Supper</span> was forgotten for the time being, under the influence
of this new source of excitement. But then the
young campers had taken the edge off their sharp appetites
before now, so that it did not matter very much.</p>

<p>Adam was grinning as he found himself the one object
upon which all eyes were focused. It would be hard to
find the boy who does not enjoy standing in the lime light,
even for a little while.</p>

<p>"How about this, Adam," said Elmer, "do you know
anything about these two men?"</p>

<p>"So," drawled the German boy, "aber I am nodt sure.
Dey looks to pe sooch; put mebbe I haf anudder guess
goming, poys."</p>

<p>"Tell us where you think you saw them," the assistant
scout master continued.</p>

<p>"At Prady's," answered Adam, promptly.</p>

<p>"Brady's&mdash;why, that's where we get our milk," spoke
up Landy.</p>

<p>"Sure it is," declared Ty. "That's funny now; I
never remember setting eyes on anybody answering that
description; and I've been over there twice."</p>

<p>"Yeth," declared Ted, "and I can thay the thame
thing."</p>

<p>"You think you can; but you're away off, Ted,"
grinned Ty, who never grew weary of nagging the other
on that lisp, with which he was afflicted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"When did you see them, Adam?" asked Elmer, paying
no attention to any of these side remarks.</p>

<p>"Vy, berhaps you may remember, Elmer, dot dis very
evening I vant to go py der voods vonce, und get dot milk.
Vat ve haf, it did get sour by der heat, und Ty he say
he haf a desire to dake der tramp again nix. So I volunteer
py der game. You pet me I nefer dry to gross dot field
py der pull. I dake der long vay, und pring der milk
safely home. Iss it not so, Ty?"</p>

<p>"Well, we're drinking some of it in our coffee this meal,
so that goes without saying," the other replied.</p>

<p>"Tell us about the men&mdash;where were they when you
saw them, Adam?" Elmer went on.</p>

<p>"Py der parn," returned the German scout.</p>

<p>"Not prowling around like a couple of thieves, Adam?"</p>

<p>"Nodt as I can see."</p>

<p>"Then what were they doing?" the patrol leader asked,
impatiently; for it was a most difficult thing to draw the
story out of the German, who seemed to want to be
"pumped" step by step, as Landy termed it.</p>

<p>"Vorking," came the short reply.</p>

<p>"Oh, then you mean they were apparently in the employ
of Mr. Brady?"</p>

<p>"Dot iss so. Dey toss der hay oop to him py der stack,
und he stow it avay."</p>

<p>"I believe the farmer is getting in a late crop of clover
hay," remarked Elmer.</p>

<p>"Yes," broke in Ty, "and he was telling me this very
morning when I got the milk, after my little adventure
with that neighbor's bull, how his man had left him in
the lurch, and everybody around was so busy he hardly
knew just how he could get the big crop of hay that was
stacked in the field, ready for the mow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Elmer nodded his head as though, after gaining this
knowledge, it was comparatively easy to put two and two
together.</p>

<p>"That settles it," he remarked. "These two hoboes
came along, and he offered them such big wages to help
him over his trouble, that they just couldn't resist. But
I know something about tramps, and the real article
wouldn't work at any price."</p>

<p>"Gee! Perhaps they had some other object in taking
the place?" Landy suggested.</p>

<p>"Just what I had in mind," Elmer followed. "If they
are the rascals who tried to throw that train off the track
for some awful reason, they must know that there'll be a
hunt through the country for them; and, perhaps, they
hope to hide as farm laborers until the thing wears off."</p>

<p>"Then we ought to warn Mr. Brady, hadn't we?"
asked Ted.</p>

<p>"Yes, but at the same time we must be careful not to
excite the suspicion of those fellows," Elmer replied; and
then turning again to Adam, he continued: "Did you
have anything to say to either of the men, Adam?"</p>

<p>"Vell," replied the other, slowly and reflectively, "I
dink me dot berhaps von off dem might dell me der vay
to der milk house, und so I stop me to ask."</p>

<p>"Yes, you asked one of them&mdash;which one, Adam?"</p>

<p>"I notice me dot as I gome close dey look at me like
I vos a pad egg, und put der heads togedder in a punch.
So I yust chuck oudt mine preast und valk right up to
der spot, like I vas say: 'Vat's der matter mit you; I
am Adam Litzburgh, und I pelong to der scouts; put dot
in your pipe und smoke it!'"</p>

<p>"But you didn't say all that; you just asked one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
them where the milk house might be; wasn't that it,
Adam?" Elmer went on.</p>

<p>"Der short von idt vas; und he turn to der udder und
he say it pe all right, nuttings to bother apout from dot
Dutch fool. Den, py chinks, he call oudt to der farmer
who vas on der top of dot haymow, und ask vere der milk
house pe."</p>

<p>"And that was all, was it, Adam?"</p>

<p>"I knows me nuddings else," replied the German boy;
"only ven I gomes me along again, der short von vaves his
hand to me, und laughs him some py my pack."</p>

<p>Elmer really sighed with relief when he realized that
he had actually succeeded in getting the whole story out
of the uncommunicative fellow. It was like "drawing
teeth," as Landy more than once remarked.</p>

<p>"You've heard the story, fellows," he said, turning to
the others; "what had we better do about it? I want
everybody to have a voice in this, and majority rules. So
don't be bashful, but speak up."</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Landy, slowly. "I suppose we
ought to give Mr. Brady a hint of the truth; but, as you
say, Elmer, we must be mighty careful how we do it.
Those tramps must be a pretty desperate pair, and they'd
think nothing of sailing in to clean us out if they suspected
we were on to their curves."</p>

<p>"How about you, Ted?" asked Elmer.</p>

<p>"Oh, count me in the thame lay," replied the one addressed.
"Nobody knowth when they're entertaining angelth
unawareth, like the good book thayth; or bad men
either. The farmerth want help tho bad at timeth that they
don't athk too many quethtionth when they get a thanthe to
employ a huthky man. We'll drop around there in the
morning thome time, when they're out in the haying field,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and give the women folkth a little hint that they'd better
get rid of the new handth."</p>

<p>"Ty?"</p>

<p>"Them's my sentiments. No special need of any hurry,
I guess," replied Ty, who was really feeling the effect of
his unusual exercise of that morning when the unfriendly
bull gave him such a lively chase, and who wanted to keep
quiet in camp.</p>

<p>"George?"</p>

<p>"Wow! You just couldn't get me to stir away from
here to-night unless you tied a pair of mules to me and
started them going," replied the newcomer, as he slyly
helped himself to more fish.</p>

<p>"And Adam?"</p>

<p>"I dinks me as how it pe werry comfortaples here,"
grinned the German, duplicating the act of George, as
though he feared lest he might not get his full share of
the supper.</p>

<p>"Hey, let me in on that, will you, fellers?" cried
Landy, spearing another portion from the rapidly vanishing
pile. "And if you want to know my sentiments,
Elmer, just put them down as 'he also ran.' Because I'm
willing to do whatever the rest of you say."</p>

<p>Elmer himself looked a trifle disappointed. He had been
thinking that perhaps they ought to warn Mr. Brady that
night; for it could not be a very safe thing to have two
such desperate men in his employ longer than was absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>Still, he had said that he would be bound by what the
majority of his chums decided was best; and he could not
change his ideas.</p>

<p>After all, the chances seemed to be that if the two
new farm hands were actually Shorty and Lanky Jim,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
their sole object in taking service with Mr. Brady must
be to lie low until the excitement died away. Consequently,
they would be very careful not to do anything
that would turn attention upon them; and in that case a
little delay could not matter.</p>

<p>"All right, then," said Elmer; "it's settled that after
breakfast to-morrow we'll make up a party to go after
milk and find a chance to warn the Brady people. Of
course the women folks will be scared nearly to death;
but they'll find some way of sending word to town in these
days of telephones. And then the officers will come out
to arrest the fellows. Pass my dish, please, Landy, and get
a small help of the fish. I'm mighty fond of it in camp,
and never care for a bite at home. And this is as good
as they make fried fish, thanks to Ty's way of cooking."</p>

<p>The balance of the supper was eaten amid a lively lot
of talk. Of course much of this concerned the events of
the day; the adventure with the bull; the trick Ty attempted
to play on Adam, with disastrous results to himself;
and last, but not least, the coming of Doubting
George with such exciting news.</p>

<p>When, finally, they went to bed it was with all these
things fastened upon their minds; so that Elmer expected
that more than one among them would be apt to "see
things" in the dark that night.</p>

<p>The fire which, after supper, had been built larger, so
that it lent a cheerful glow to the scene, was allowed to
die down. Really the weather was still so sultry that it
took away some of the pleasure of sitting around a blaze;
which is always appreciated most when there is a tang of
frost in the night air; but, then, these boys were up here
for fun and did not mean to be cheated out of anything
they considered their due by such a thing as hot air.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>One by one they crawled under the canvas and subsided.</p>

<p>The coming of George promised to add to the discomfort
of a crowded tent; and secretly Elmer had decided
that he would not occupy his quarters of the preceding
nights. It would not be a new thing at all for him to
sleep out under the stars with a blanket for a covering;
and, indeed, he believed he would enjoy the experience,
as it must revive recollections of the past when he was
accompanying the cowboys on a round-up far away from
the home ranch; or else off with a comrade on a hunt in
the big Rocky Mountains of Canada.</p>

<p>Only one more day remained, and then the wagon would
come for the tent and other things that had to be transported
by team. After that they could look forward to
a few days of restlessness; when school duties would begin
once more.</p>

<p>Elmer noticed that there was little talking indulged in
that night. They seemed too tired all around for any
"funny business," such as often marked the period when
the lively boys started to go to bed.</p>

<p>When all seemed quiet within the tent, Elmer stepped
over to where he had slyly hidden his blanket some little
time before. He had already picked out the spot in which
he intended passing the night. It was under a tree, where
he could look up through the leafy branches, and get
glimpses of the star-decked heavens. The soft, caressing
touch of the night wind would lull him to sleep, he felt
sure; and on the whole Elmer infinitely preferred such an
experience to being crammed up against five others, in one
small tent.</p>

<p>So he fixed himself, and lay down. By turning his
head he could see the flickering fire, and imagine it surrounded
by some of those good fellows whom he had known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
long ago, daring riders of bucking bronchos, and expert
wielders of the flying rope.</p>

<p>Then Elmer dropped off into a sound sleep. The last
thing he remembered was hearing some one snoring in
the tent; he never knew just who the guilty party might
be, although his suspicions pointed to George; since they
had not been afflicted up to his coming. And the sounds
seemed uncertain too, just as though they were inclined to
express a lingering doubt.</p>

<p>From this state of peace and calm the campers were
suddenly aroused by a most piercing scream, that rang
through the woods on the borders of the river.</p>

<p>Instantly a scene of wild confusion resulted. Out from
the narrow exit of the tent came a struggling mass of boys
in pajamas, grabbing hold of each other in their excitement.</p>

<p>And one lone figure might have been seen crawling under
the back canvas, in much the same fashion as Elmer had
done at the time he started on that hunt for the unknown
party who was throwing the stones with a plunk into the
river.</p>

<p>Elmer was on his feet instantly, and could, perhaps, be
said to be the only one in the lot who had control of his
senses in this emergency.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE INVASION OF THE CAMP.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Oh!</span> what is it?" cried Landy, who was actually
trembling all over as he stood there in the night air, which
had grown a trifle cooler during the hours they had been
asleep.</p>

<p>"What's Elmer going to do?" exclaimed George, as
he saw the patrol leader spring suddenly forward, and
bend down.</p>

<p>"He'th got thomebody!" yelled Ted. "Perhapth it'th
jutht one of the trampth come over here to rob the
camp!"</p>

<p>"Aber I dinks me he iss yust getting some off der vood
to puts on der fire," remarked Adam, who, strange to say,
in all the excitement, seemed to keep fairly calm.</p>

<p>It turned out to be exactly the case; for immediately
Elmer threw something on the smouldering fire, which
started up a cheery blaze. When this came about it was
wonderful how much better all of them felt. A crackling
fire can do more to dispel thoughts of ghosts, and all such
silly things, than any other agency.</p>

<p>"But Ted," said George, "I don't think you could
have guessed right, because you see there ain't any sign
of a tramp here."</p>

<p>"Sounded to me," ventured Landy, "like it was out
there on the river. Say, p'raps it might have been some
poor duck just going down for the last time!"</p>

<p>"Shucks!" grunted that unbeliever, George; "he'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
never be able to let out such a whang-doodle yell in that
case. I ought to know, because I've near drowned myself
twice, and all I could do was just to gurgle and kick and
grab."</p>

<p>"How about that loon Elmer wath telling uth about?"
suggested Ted, softly. "From all he thaid I reckon it'd
let out jutht thuch a noithe ath that."</p>

<p>"Elmer, you heard it, didn't you?" demanded Landy.</p>

<p>"I sure did," came the reply.</p>

<p>"Wath it a loon, then?" went on Ted.</p>

<p>"Not the kind you mean, boys; I give you that
straight," replied the other.</p>

<p>"But it came from out there on the river, didn't it?"
persisted Landy, who seemed to have that notion imbedded
in his brain pretty strongly.</p>

<p>Elmer shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p>"Then where did it come from?" asked Landy.</p>

<p>"I didn't tell you, boys," went on the patrol leader;
"but knowing that six in the tent would make it stuffy,
I planned to sleep out here under the stars, just as I've
done many a night, you know. And so I was in a pretty
good position to hear where that whoop came from."</p>

<p>"Tell us, Elmer, tell us right away," demanded Landy,
impatiently.</p>

<p>"The tent!" said Elmer, without hesitation.</p>

<p>The boys stared at each other.</p>

<p>"Say, he means that one of us let that yell out,"
remarked Landy.</p>

<p>"I know I didn't!" declared George.</p>

<p>"Not guilty!" chirped Ted immediately, holding up
his right hand as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Noddings doing, poys, mit me," Adam ventured to
say, positively.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"How about Ty?" asked Elmer, chuckling.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" demanded Landy.</p>

<p>And thus, all at once, they awakened to the fact that
one of their number was absent, though no one save Elmer
had noticed this before.</p>

<p>Landy rushed to the tent and looked in. The fire was
by this time giving out enough light to make it possible
to see the entire interior.</p>

<p>Landy crawled inside, and almost immediately came
forth again.</p>

<p>"Say, he ain't there! Ty's disappeared, fellows!
Mebbe he's been taken with a fit, and jumped into the
river!" he cried, in tones that were filled with horror.</p>

<p>"Elmer, what have you got to thay about that?" demanded
Ted, who had noticed the significant fact that the
patrol leader did not seem to share the alarm of the rest;
indeed, he even smiled as though amused.</p>

<p>"Watch me," said Elmer.</p>

<p>He strode back of the tent, while the other boys waited
with wondering eyes. In a minute Elmer reappeared, nor
was he alone. He had hold of a shrinking figure, also clad
in pajamas, and these of so violent a color that they instantly
recognized them as belonging to the boy who had
clung so long to that red sweater.</p>

<p>Yes, it was surely Ty, and he did not seem to be suffering
to any great extent. There was evidence of a grin
hovering around the corners of his mouth. Evidently Ty
was the one who had crawled hastily under the canvas of
the tent after that fearful yell had awakened the entire
party. "The wicked flee when no man pursueth," and
Ty knew that he was probably in for a good raking, after
giving his mates so great a scare.</p>

<p>"Hey, he's got him!" declared Landy. "Elmer knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
where to find him. See here, did you let off that awful
whoop, Ty Collins?"</p>

<p>"I s'pose I did," replied the culprit, meekly. "I was
dreaming about that old bull, you see. Thought I was
sitting up there between his horns, and he was just <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'galivanting'">gallivanting</ins>
around the whole country with me, jumpin' fences
and all that. Then we came to a barn, oh, as high as the
church steeple at Hickory Ridge; and as sure as you live
if that critter didn't make straight for the same. I felt
him rising in the air like a balloon, and then I think I
must have let out a squawk, fellers."</p>

<p>"Listen to him, would you!" cried Landy; "he calls
that a squawk! Why, it sounded like a whistle for down-brakes
on the track; or else a feller falling over a precipice
ten thousand feet deep! And he's got the nerve to
say it was only a little squawk, just like a chicken would
give!"</p>

<p>"Well, if you'd been dreaming like I was, you'd holler
too," argued Ty. "Say, I reckon I scared myself pretty
bad too, for I crawled out of the back of the tent in a
big hurry, and tried to hide in the bushes. Then I heard
you talkin' and it struck me what I'd done. Didn't feel
much like walkin' in after that; but Elmer, he came and
convinced me."</p>

<p>"No great harm done, boys," said Elmer. "And as
Ty didn't mean to frighten anybody, we'll have to let him
off this time."</p>

<p>"Yes, if he'll promise not to repeat the dose, we might,"
grumbled Landy.</p>

<p>"Don't believe him, if he does, because he won't keep
his word," declared Doubting George.</p>

<p>"Well, what sort of remedy would you suggest?" asked
Ty, indignantly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gag him; that's the only way," returned George;
"and even then I think he'd find a loophole to let out
another howl. Ty always could whoop it up better than
any other fellow at school. That's why they made him
the cheer captain when he couldn't get in the football game
on account of a sprain."</p>

<p>"You just try it," muttered Ty. "I've got troubles
enough, and a plenty; but a gag is going it a little too
strong. Elmer says it's all right, and that anybody is
liable to have bad dreams. Think of what I went through
with, when that bull chased after me! Forget it, fellers,
and let's go back to our blankets."</p>

<p>"Yes, get along there, the whole bunch of you,"
laughed Elmer, pretending to "shoo" them as he might
a flock of little chickens. "It's getting cool out here, and
we've got a few more hours for sleep. So long!"</p>

<p>So the five crept inside the tent again, and for some
little while the murmur of voices told that they did not find
it so easy to drop off into sleep as on the earlier occasion.</p>

<p>But finally all became silent. The episode was closed;
and once more sleep dominated the camp by the Sweetwater.</p>

<p>There was no further alarm that night. Perhaps Ty
took warning from the awful proposition made by George,
and found some way of restraining his inclination to
dream; but no one ever knew how he did it.</p>

<p>When early morning came, with the cheep of birds in
the thickets, Elmer was the first one to be stirring. He
kindled the fire afresh, and tidied up around the camp
a bit, after the manner that was so much to his liking.</p>

<p>Then he went down to the river and plunged in.</p>

<p>It was now broad daylight; indeed, the sun was peeping
up beyond the low hills far away to the east. The sound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of splashing must have reached the ears of Landy as he
awakened, for presently he came crawling forth.</p>

<p>"Hi, get up there, you sleepy-heads!" he shouted,
stooping to thrust his head into the tent. "Here's Elmer
occupying the whole river, and there won't be any of it
left if you don't hurry!"</p>

<p>That brought the balance out in a hurry, and soon the
six were sporting gayly in the water. Adam had to do
the high dive, with all its attendant "frills," as Landy
called them, in the way of double somersaults, backward
and forward, in order to convince the newcomer of his
accomplishments. For, of course, Doubting George refused
to believe until he had been shown; and even then
declared that there must be some sort of trick about it,
because it stood to reason that a greenhorn could not excel
in anything.</p>

<p>Adam, however, was too good-natured to take offense.
As long as they remained in the water he was kept busy
showing the many tricks he knew. Tenderfoot though he
might be in most things connected with boy life in America,
Adam certainly stood in a class by himself when it
came to aquatic events.</p>

<p>Then came the pleasing job of getting breakfast. Ty,
assisted by George, consented to look after that part of
the business. Since George would only have one whole
day in camp, with two nights thrown in, he purposed getting
all he could out of it, and had laid out a list of
things he wished to try before sundown, consisting of fishing,
taking a few pictures with a little camera he had
fetched along, and roaming the neighboring country, looking
for promising nut trees for the October gathering,
because George was very fond of hickory nuts, chestnuts
and walnuts, in season and out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just as like as not there won't be a fish willing to
nibble at my bait," he grumbled, after his customary
fashion; "and I'd like to wager that this year is a bad
one for nuts."</p>

<p>"Oh, let up on that cranky way of looking at things,"
said Ty. "Perhaps something's the matter with your new
camera too, George!"</p>

<p>"Well, you never know," replied the other, sighing.
"It looks all right; but the proof of the pudding lies in
the eating; and I'm sorter expecting the thing to turn out
a fizzle. Cheap things never do amount to much, you
know."</p>

<p>"But that was a present on your birthday!" ejaculated
Ty.</p>

<p>"Sure it was; but all the same it's not one of the best;
and I'm always suspicious of these things that don't cost
top-notch prices," George continued.</p>

<p>"I'd just like to know what you ain't suspicious of,"
snapped Ty. "Here, don't you go smelling at my flapjacks
like you thought there was a bad egg in 'em. Every
egg we get is fresh from the coop that day, and marked
gilt edge. Before I'd have a way like yours, George, I'd,
well, I believe I'd jump in the river."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you would," grinned George, once
again true to his reputation as a skeptic.</p>

<p>"What's Elmer going to say?" remarked Ty, he
noticed the patrol leader coming hastily into camp, with
a queer look on his face.</p>

<p>"Get ready!" Elmer said, mysteriously.</p>

<p>Ty, Ted, George and Landy looked up at this.</p>

<p>"Get ready for what!" demanded the fat boy, attempting
to gain his feet in haste, but having to clutch hold of
Ted in order to assist himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"To vacate the camp," replied the other.</p>

<p>"But, Elmer, explain, won't you?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"Yes, tell us why we must get out," echoed George, and
adding: "I don't believe he means anything at all, that's
what; he's just fooling us, fellows."</p>

<p>"Wait and see," Elmer continued, gravely nodding his
head, although his eyes were sparkling with humor. "It's
coming, and I tell you that after it arrives there won't
be any room here for you fellows. It will occupy the
whole place!"</p>

<p>"But, Elmer, what is it that's coming?" asked Landy,
visions of the two desperate hoboes filling his mind.</p>

<p>Elmer, in reply, commenced to raise his head, and make
a face as he sniffed the air.</p>

<p>"Just try that and see," he remarked, simply.</p>

<p>Upon that the whole lot started to drawing in their
breath. Immediately various exclamations told that they
had "caught on," as Landy expressed it.</p>

<p>"Oh, murder! What sort of an odor is that!" ejaculated
George.</p>

<p>"I know!" cried Landy, who had started to clutch his
nose between thumb and fingers; "it's a skunk, that's
what it is. Wow! It's getting worse all the time, too!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE EDUCATION OF ADAM.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> utmost consternation seized upon the campers.</p>

<p>"Oh! what's bringing all that smell along here?"
George cried; for this was his first experience with such
a thing, though he had heard lots about other adventures
the scouts had had in that line.</p>

<p>"It's Adam; he's got a monopoly of the scent!"
laughed Elmer. "And he's on his way to the camp right
now. I saw him coming, and got a whiff; then I hurried on
to warn you, because I didn't want you to be caught unprepared.
There's one good thing about it, though, fellows."</p>

<p>"Good thing?" ejaculated Ted, who had snatched out
his handkerchief and was trying to keep from inhaling
more air than was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," Elmer went on, "for once George here
doesn't doubt but that he gets it. You don't hear him
asking questions now. He <i>knows</i> it's here with us. He's
getting his dose, all right, ain't you, George?"</p>

<p>"Look, there he comes!" gasped Landy, pointing to a
moving figure that was pawing a way through the neighboring
thicket.</p>

<p>"Ach! vat iss de matter mit me? I feels like I vas
goin' to faint!" exclaimed a complaining voice.</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake do it out there, then!" screamed
Landy. "Don't you dare come into camp with that terrible
smell hanging to you. Sit down where you are, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
listen to what we've got to say. Oh, gracious, I can't get
my breath! Elmer, you tell him!"</p>

<p>"Py chimineddy, dis makes me some drouples! It peats
all der limpurger cheese I ever saw. Vat vos idt, Elmer? I
am nodt choking, tell me vot I dood," Adam asked, with
a beseeching air, for he was almost overcome by the fumes.</p>

<p>"Well, if you ain't choking, we are; so you stay there,"
George remarked.</p>

<p>"How did it happen, Adam?" asked Elmer, trying to
stop laughing, for he knew that after all this was apt to
be a serious piece of business for the other.</p>

<p>But the German boy only shook his head and coughed,
as he tried to get his breath.</p>

<p>"Idt iss some foolishness py me; but, poys, I don't know
vot it iss already yet. I vos vandering apout der voods, enchoying
mineself, ven I see der prettiest little squirrel dot
ever vos, mit a nice white stripe, und a pushy tail. I dinks
dot he look like he vill pe friends mit me, und so I yust
hold out mine hand und call him; put pefore I could take
hold mit him, I dink I step on von of dem musherooms mit
der awful smell. Ach! it vos so pad I haf to get oudt
right avay, und come pack to der gamp. I'm von sick
Dutchman, poys, pelieve me. I dink me I must pe going
to die right avay qvick."</p>

<p>"I should think you had died a week ago," cried George.</p>

<p>"He thought the skunk was a pretty squirrel," said Ty;
"and he was going to make a pet of it, think of that,
fellows!"</p>

<p>They laughed and coughed by turns. One minute the
comical side of the event appealed to them, as they saw
poor Adam standing there looking so forlorn; then as if by
magic their humor turned, and they began to wonder what
in the wide world could be done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"We just can't stand this much longer, Elmer," said
Landy. "Make him go away off in the woods and bury
himself."</p>

<p>"Well, one thing's sure," remarked the patrol leader.
"He's got to get rid of every stitch he has on him. We'll
have to rig him out the best we can afterwards."</p>

<p>Adam set up a howl upon hearing this.</p>

<p>"I pelieve it might wash oudt in der river!" he declared.</p>

<p>"Not in a thousand years," Landy made answer. "The
only chance for you is to go off and bury your clothes&mdash;everything
you've got on. Then get in the water, and try
to get rid of the smell from your hair. Lucky thing it's
cut short. Oh, ain't this the meanest luck, though?"</p>

<p>"It might be worse if the whole lot of us had been there
and got our share," remarked Elmer, who could always
see things on the bright side, in which he was the exact
reverse of Doubting George.</p>

<p>"Dell me vat I must do, Elmer. I promise to carry
oudt de plans. Somedings must pe done right qvick, or
I shall pe smothered. It is pad; but I am von scout, und
can take der hard knocks mit der good."</p>

<p>"That's the kind of talk, Adam," Elmer hastened to
say. "You're all right, even if you do seem unpleasant
company just now. Listen to me. Go back into the woods
a piece. Then strip off every rag and hide them in some
hollow log. I'll follow you when you go to the river, and
fetch along what stuff we find we can spare. All told I
reckon there'll be a shirt, trousers and shoes for you; and
that's all you need this hot weather. Please make a start,
for we've got to the end of our endurance. Turn around;
now you're off!"</p>

<p>When the unfortunate German lad had vanished, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
trouble was far from being at an end. He left a decided
legacy behind him, and Landy was loud in his wails.</p>

<p>"How ever can we stand it, Elmer?" he asked. "All
the rest of the time we stay in camp do we just have to endure
that rank odor?"</p>

<p>"'What can't be cured must be endured,' you remember
we used to write in our copybooks at school, Landy," replied
the patrol leader. "Nothing like getting used to
things, you know. It isn't pleasant, of course; but there
might be worse happen to us. Suppose now our new recruit
had run across a rattlesnake instead of a polecat! But get
a hustle on you, fellows, and see if we can rig Adam out
somehow. I've got an extra shirt he's welcome to."</p>

<p>"And there's that pair of trousers I brought along,"
said Landy; "he can get into them all right. But I'll say
good-by when I hand 'em over; for I just know the perfume
will stick always; and I never could stand it, never."</p>

<p>Some one else came forward with shoes, and in this
fashion the wretched victim of confiding innocence and curiosity
was supplied with an outfit calculated to carry him
through.</p>

<p>Taking these things with him, Elmer started forth along
the trail of Adam.</p>

<p>"Just follow your nose, and you'll find him!" sang
out Landy.</p>

<p>"And look out you don't repeat his sad experience,
Elmer," laughed Ty.</p>

<p>The woods seemed to be pretty strong with the powerful
odor, as Elmer walked on. He was a fair hand at following
a trail, and the German lad had certainly not made
any effort to conceal his footprints.</p>

<p>Presently Elmer found where Adam had stuffed his garments
into a hollow log, just as he had been told; but as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
he was no longer in sight, the scout patrol leader took it
for granted that he had turned to head for the river again,
in order to plunge in.</p>

<p>Accordingly Elmer also turned and walked that way,
believing that he would strike the stream a little distance
below the camp.</p>

<p>"Goodness! I hope, now, Adam doesn't lose himself
in the woods!" he exclaimed, as a sudden startling thought
flashed into his mind. "Wouldn't that just be the limit,
though, and with not a bit of clothes along!"</p>

<p>But a minute later he caught sight of the other stalking
along ahead. The river could also be seen in glimpses
between the trees, showing that after all Adam had chosen
the right course.</p>

<p>"Well, what ails him now?" Elmer asked himself, for
as he looked he suddenly saw the German boy bound up
into the air, and start to threshing about with his hands
in the wildest kind of way.</p>

<p>Then he started to run madly along, letting out a series of
shouts, and finally taking a header from the bank into the
river.</p>

<p>Something came buzzing about Elmer's head.</p>

<p>"Hornets!" he exclaimed, making a stroke at the insistent
insect that was trying to reach his face, until by a
fortunate blow he sent it down.</p>

<p>Then he started off, making a wide detour so as to avoid
the spot where the unlucky Adam must have run foul of
the nest.</p>

<p>When he finally drew up at the river bank and peeped
over, he saw Adam with everything but the upper part of
his head submerged. He seemed to be looking for a new
assortment of enemies hovering over him. His introduction
to the mysteries of the great American woods bade fair to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
make a great impression on Adam. Indeed, when finally
Elmer induced him to come forth, he discovered that there
were three distinct impressions, and each of them as large
as a hickory nut, one being behind the ear, another on his
right arm, and a third on the calf of his leg, where the
angry little hornets had left their mark.</p>

<p>No doubt the new recruit thought he was having a pretty
rough time of it all told. But he had a genial nature, and
could take things as they came; so that presently he was
able to laugh at his misfortunes.</p>

<p>When he was dressed in the borrowed clothes Adam
looked a "sight," as Landy declared after he saw him
coming to the camp. Of course there must hover around
him more or less of the strong odor; but Elmer told the
others they must make up their minds to get used to that,
as it could not be remedied.</p>

<p>Breakfast had been ready for some little time when the
pair reached the camp; and all of them were able to do justice
to the meal. Even Adam seemed to have retained his
appetite.</p>

<p>"But it's the only thing he did save," chuckled Landy.</p>

<p>When the meal was over, Elmer reminded them of the
arrangement they had made on the previous evening.</p>

<p>"Who goes along with me to Brady's?" he asked, getting
up.</p>

<p>"Don't you think we'd all better paddle along?" remarked
Landy; "because, you see, those fellows are tough
characters; and it might be they'd set on our crowd, if
they suspected we'd come to tell on 'em."</p>

<p>"Count me out," said George. "You know I got a
stone bruise yesterday when on the way here, and I want
to let it heal up, so's to be able to toddle back home when
we break camp to-morrow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, rats! The chances are you don't think there's anything
worth while in going over there," declared Ty.
"And I meant to show you just where I had all that fun
with the old bull, too."</p>

<p>"Fun!" shrieked Landy. "Hear that, will you, boys?
He calls that business just fun. But it looked another way,
then, you understand, George. Why, Ty's face was as
white as paper when he thought that old bundle of beef
was going to hook him higher than a kite!"</p>

<p>But Ty declined to argue the matter with him.</p>

<p>"And I think Adam had better thtay at home, don't
you, Elmer?" remarked Ted.</p>

<p>"Why, he's that strong he could tackle the hobo crowd
alone and single-handed," observed Ty.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he'd turn all the milk in the dairy,"
chuckled Landy.</p>

<p>So it was presently decided that two of the scouts were
to remain behind to take charge of the camp. The others,
four in number, would trail along toward the Brady farm;
and if the opportunity presented itself, let the farmer's
women folks know the character of the new hands.</p>

<p>The last that Elmer and his comrades saw of those who
were to remain behind, George seemed to be endeavoring to
coax Adam to try his luck again on the river, for he was
holding out the rod of the German.</p>

<p>"He just wants to get him away for a while," laughed
Ty.</p>

<p>"It looks like George had run up against something at
last that won't stand for any doubts," declared Landy, who
had long suffered from this peculiar malady on the part of
his cousin.</p>

<p>"If it can't be seen, it makes itself felt in another way,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
remarked Elmer, who was in the lead of the file that headed
through the woods, Ted swinging the tin milk bucket.</p>

<p>Reaching the field where Ty had had so much "fun"
with the ugly bull, they failed to see anything of the animal.</p>

<p>"Afraid to come out again, you see, boys," said Ty,
pretending to puff out with valor. "I guess the farmer
who owns him will keep him shut up till we leave the
neighborhood. He'd better, for I was just hatching up
some game that would discourage the old fellow from tackling
every one that walked through his pasture."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he's loose, and carrying on somewhere else,"
remarked Elmer, as he lifted his head in an attitude of
listening.</p>

<p>"Say, that <i>is</i> somebody shouting, as sure as you live!"
cried Landy.</p>

<p>"And hollering to beat the band, too!" echoed Ty.</p>

<p>The whole four of them stood still, the better to listen.
There could be no longer the least doubt about the matter;
for other voices joined in with the one they had heard at
first.</p>

<p>"It's women yelling, too," said Landy. "Whatever
can be the matter? Elmer, do you think it's that bull broke
loose?"</p>

<p>"More'n likely the hoboes are at the bottom of the
row!" declared Ty.</p>

<p>"Come on with me, fellows, and we'll soon know!"
called Elmer, as he immediately started off on a full run.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A LOUD CALL FOR HELP.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A bell</span> began to ring wildly near by.</p>

<p>"That's over to the place where the bull belongs; sure
the row ain't there, Elmer?" asked Ty, as he hurried on
the heels of the leader.</p>

<p>Elmer paused to listen again.</p>

<p>"No," he said, positively, "most all the racket is over
yonder in the direction of the Brady house. You can hear
the women screaming, too. Come along again, boys!
They've heard the racket over here, and that bell's to call
the men in from the fields."</p>

<p>"Sounds just for all the world like what I've read
about an Injun attack in the good old pioneer days,"
declared the panting Landy, who had to exert himself more
than any of the others in order to keep up with the procession.</p>

<p>"Theemth like I thmell thmoke!" remarked Ted.</p>

<p>"I reckon you do, because I've been getting it for the
last half minute," Elmer threw over his shoulder as he
ran on.</p>

<p>"That means a fire!" cried Ty.</p>

<p>"It generally does," Elmer added, dryly.</p>

<p>"What if the Brady house is going up in flames?"
ejaculated Ty, again.</p>

<p>"It would be a bad job," remarked Elmer; "but not
quite as hard on them as if it happened in the dead of
winter, with the thermometer down to zero."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it's always a hard job fighting fire in such steaming
hot weather as this September spell!" Landy observed,
as he dug for his handkerchief, so as to wipe his red face,
which was beginning to reek with perspiration.</p>

<p>"There, I saw smoke over the trees; it's a house afire,
as sure as anything, boys, and the Brady one at that!"
declared Ty.</p>

<p>None of them doubted it now, since all the indications
seemed to point that way. They kept up their forward
rush, hoping to at least be able to lend a helping hand in
the way of getting some of the furniture out; because that
is generally all that can be done at a country blaze, when
there are no fire engines to respond to the call for aid.</p>

<p>They were rapidly overtaking several persons who seemed
to be hurrying in the same direction they themselves were
bound. Two of these were women, and the other a very old
man, whom the excitement had stirred into unwonted
action.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Elmer, as he was passing the three.</p>

<p>"The Brady house must be afire!" answered a young
woman, who seemed to have her wits fairly well in hand.</p>

<p>None of the boys stopped, though Landy's tongue was
almost hanging from his mouth because of the exertion on
such a hot morning. They continued to bound along steadily,
and expected to come in sight of the burning house at
any moment now.</p>

<p>As they burst out from the cover it stood before them.
Smoke was coming from windows and doors in heavy volumes;
and evidently the fire must have managed to get
considerable headway before being discovered.</p>

<p>A number of women were running excitedly up and down
doing nothing to aid in saving property, or subduing the
flames. Several men were present, and seemed to be wholly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
engaged in carrying out some of the furniture belonging to
the parlor. A small cabinet organ had been rolled over on
the grass, and then they added heaps of books to the wreckage.</p>

<p>"Why don't they try and save the house, Elmer?" asked
Ty, as they saw what was going on.</p>

<p>"I don't know, unless it's because they have no leader,
and nobody is able to tell what to do," replied the other.</p>

<p>Elmer was taking the scene in with eyes that nothing
escaped. Even while he was running forward toward the
fire he saw that there was a fair-sized stream close to the
barns. His attention was directed to it chiefly because of a
flock of big white Pekin ducks that were flapping their
wings, and adding their loud quacks to the general excitement.</p>

<p>"If we only could find plenty of buckets, something
might be done!" he called back over his shoulder, never
stopping an instant in making for the building that was
threatened with destruction.</p>

<p>"I see three right now by that pump!" cried Ty.</p>

<p>"Plenty more in the barn, Elmer!" added Ted, who
saw what the other had in his mind, and thought it worth
trying.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of tin milk buckets hanging on that
fence!" called Landy.</p>

<p>"Go for 'em, fellows!" ordered the patrol leader.
"Gather all you can find, and begin to fill 'em at the
brook. I'll see if these ladies won't stand in line, and pass
them along."</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the Hickory Ridge Fire Brigade!"
shouted Landy, fully filled with the novel idea.</p>

<p>Each of them made a bee-line for the buckets in sight,
and, gathering up all they could lay hands on, immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
started for the water, where a great dipping began, to the
intense amazement and consternation of the ducks, which
could not understand why these strangers should try to
empty their favorite little stream without asking their permission.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Elmer must have managed to explain after
a fashion what he purposed doing. He had already coaxed
two of the women to stand ready to take the buckets as
they came along, and these were shouting to the others.</p>

<p>"More buckets! Try in the barns for some!" called
Elmer, as, seizing one of the first that arrived, he rushed
up to where a tongue of fire had suddenly darted out of a
window, like a snake that was striking, and sent the contents
of his receptacle through into the room.</p>

<p>Now something a little more like sense seemed to seize
upon those present. All they needed was a leader, some one
capable of giving orders; and it would be surprising how
much could be accomplished.</p>

<p>The men stopped trying to save the furniture. If the
building could be kept from burning to the ground the
things it contained might have a chance of being spared.
They rushed away to the barn, as though knowing where
horse buckets were to be found; and Elmer knew that he
had found several willing allies in his battle with the flames.</p>

<p>He saw that these men were the farmer himself, and his
son, almost a man in size. The two farm hands were not to
be seen; and this fact gave Elmer a strong idea that in truth
they might have been responsible for the fire itself. Sometimes
when a robbery has been committed the thieves will
try to cover all traces of their work by burning the building.</p>

<p>By the time those other women had arrived he believed
he would have enough on the ground to form a living chain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
between the brook and the house, so that the full buckets
could be passed swiftly along from hand to hand, and the
empties returned after the same fashion for a fresh start.</p>

<p>Inside of five minutes after the Boy Scouts arrived on
the spot it was a lively scene that was taking place. The
smoke continued to pour out of the windows; but whenever
a bit of flame showed itself, Elmer or Ty was ready
to dash a bucket of water on the same.</p>

<p>"Keep up the good work, fellows!" shouted Landy,
who was filling the buckets at the time. "She ain't gaining
much, now; and every one that comes just adds to the
fire brigade, so's to send the buckets along faster. I'm
coming over to help fight soon as that farmer's boy gets
here!"</p>

<p>"Say, if only we had all our troop here, Elmer, wouldn't
we make short work of it, though?" asked Ty, who was
beginning to turn many shades darker because of the smoke
that swept past him every little while.</p>

<p>"We'll do it as we are!" answered the patrol leader,
firmly; for he believed that they must soon begin to get
the mastery over the hungry flames.</p>

<p>Then Landy came staggering along, bearing with him a
huge bucket, which he expected to dash personally on some
place where it would do the most good. The farmer's boy
had arrived to take his place at the brook, which set him
free for sterner duties.</p>

<p>"Go for it, fellers!" he gasped; and then as a wicked
looking finger of fire darted out toward him he emptied the
contents of his pail in that direction. "Plenty more where
that came from. The crick'll hold out all right, if only we
can get it up here fast enough. That's the way, Ty, soak
it to the measly old thing. We're going to win out yet,
see!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the right sort, of spirit to show at any rate; and
afterwards his chums had only words of praise for Landy's
conduct.</p>

<p>"If we c'n only hold out long enough, we're just bound
to knock this old fire into a cocked hat!" Ty managed to
cry out, as he seized another bucket, and turned to look for
a chance to use it.</p>

<p>Just then he noticed a small girl standing near by, sobbing
as if her heart would break. She seemed to be looking
up toward the second story windows of the house that was
on fire, as though there might be something that she longed
to save up there.</p>

<p>Ty was immediately thrilled with the thought that it
might be a human being. Nobody had as yet said anything
about a missing person, whether a child, a very old man,
or a woman; but this might come from the fact that such
tremendous excitement held everybody in its grip.</p>

<p>Ty had read about daring feats which lads no older than
himself had performed at such critical times. Perhaps
within his soul there burned a desire to outshine these
heroes of fact and fiction; and do something to make the
name of Tyrus Collins go ringing down the ages, on the
annals of heroes who have risked their lives in order to save
others.</p>

<p>At any rate, as soon as he had emptied the bucket he was
holding, he passed it along to the nearest woman, and then
whirled upon the little girl.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" he asked.</p>

<p>She turned to him eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll be burned, my little baby, Bennie!" she
wailed, wringing her hands as if in the greatest woe.</p>

<p>Ty was thrilled by the words. Here then was the golden
opportunity he had long sought. A baby, she had said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
forgotten in the mad rush and excitement. And to him had
come the chance to show of what metal scouts were made.</p>

<p>"Where is he&mdash;show me the window of the room!" he
demanded in such a stern tone that the child shrank back;
but she managed to point upward and say:</p>

<p>"That window&mdash;it's the little room over the front hall!
Oh, if you could only bring him out, mister; everybody's
too busy to remember poor little Bennie!"</p>

<p>That finished Ty. He heard the call to duty and was
off. Still, he kept his wits about him fairly well, and did
not plunge recklessly into the building.</p>

<p>His first act was to take another look upward, so that he
might locate the window she had mentioned, and remember
which it was when groping about the interior. Elmer was
close by; but although he turned toward the patrol leader at
first, Ty changed his mind, fearing that he might be interfered
with in his bold designs.</p>

<p>No, if a rescue must be made, he would go it alone; and
hence all the glory that was coming would be his.</p>

<p>"Here, take that full bucket and follow me, Ty!" called
Elmer, who saw a chance to deluge a threatened point in
such a way that the fire would be fully beaten back in that
quarter.</p>

<p>He supposed the other was carrying out his suggestion,
and did not know any different until on turning he found
himself face to face with Landy, who had quickly taken the
place of the one called upon.</p>

<p>"Where's Ty?" asked Elmer, as upon looking around
he failed to discover the figure of his late assistant.</p>

<p>"He's gone in!" declared Landy, seeming to be a little
appalled by something he had witnessed.</p>

<p>"Gone in where?" continued the other, hardly understanding
what was meant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"He rushed right into the house like he'd lost his senses,
Elmer; whatever do you think made him act like that?"
Landy replied.</p>

<p>The patrol leader looked aghast.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," he replied, "unless he heard
that some one was in there, and might be smothered or
burned. But it was a nervy thing for Ty to do. I only
hope he comes out again all right!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SHOWING THEIR METTLE.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, thay, can't we do anything to thave him?"</p>

<p>It was, of course, Ted, with his lisp, who said this. He
had come up while the others were talking, and seemed
to understand the situation; perhaps he had even witnessed
the strange dash of Ty Collins into the burning
farmhouse.</p>

<p>Elmer shook his head in the negative, as he replied:</p>

<p>"You see, the smoke is so heavy that even if one of us
did go in, the chances are he'd never be able to find Ty.
We'll have to let him alone. Ty has a long head on him,
and generally knows what he's doing. Let's work away
here as fast as they fetch us the full buckets, and hope
our chum will get out again. Here, hand me that pail,
Ted; and get busy, Landy. No time to be staring around."</p>

<p>Landy seemed to be half stunned because of the queer
actions of the scout who had entered the house. He was
standing there looking up at the row of windows, out of
which the smoke curled and eddied, as though he expected
an answer to the puzzling question there.</p>

<p>But the energy of the patrol leader influenced him; and
taking the bucket that had reached the end of the line
of men and women, he hastened to dash its contents in
the spot Elmer indicated.</p>

<p>The boys were all showing more or less signs of exhaustion
by this time, owing to the terrific heat, caused by the
stickiness of the weather, and the influence of the fire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
But not one of them gave any indication of showing the
white feather. They seemed to feel that the honor of the
scouts was involved in this fight for the farmer's home;
and with set teeth they continued to ply the water.</p>

<p>"We're gaining a little all the time, fellows!" exclaimed
Elmer, meaning to bolster up the courage of both
Ted and Landy; though often he would cast an anxious
eye up at those mute windows, as though beginning to
fear that the missing chum would never again appear.</p>

<p>"Yeth," said Ted, dolefully, "but every time we leave
a plathe to go to a new one, the fire tharth out again freth
ath a daithy. If only a lot more men would come to help
uth out, we might get it under."</p>

<p>"We will do it, boys, just make up your minds to that,"
gasped Elmer, as he once more gripped a big stable bucket
and started back to the window through which he expected
to hurl the contents. "We've got the grit to stick
to the job to the bitter end, and grit wins the day every
time. Hurry up there with that other pail; and tell
them to find some more, if they can. Anything will do that
can hold water. We've just <i>got</i> to put this thing out!
That's the way, Landy; you did a good job that time!"</p>

<p>Those words of praise did more to inspire new faith and
confidence in the heart of the almost exhausted fat boy
than anything else could have done. He seemed to pluck
up fresh courage, braced himself to his task, and even
grinned at Elmer, although it was a sickly attempt at a
smile.</p>

<p>Landy was, indeed, a sight just then. He was wet to
the skin with perspiration and spilled water from the
creek. Besides, his usually jolly face was streaked with
a series of queer marks, where the black smoke had found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
lodgment, and been ground in every time he drew his
sleeve across his smarting eyes.</p>

<p>But then the others were little better off, though possibly
they did not feel the terrible heat quite so much as
the stout youth. Regardless of the damage to their clothes
they labored faithfully on, determined that the Hickory
Ridge troop was bound to receive new honor because of
what they did at the Brady fire.</p>

<p>Seconds had merged into minutes, and Elmer's anxiety
grew to an alarming extent. What if poor Ty had, indeed,
fallen in the midst of that smoke and was lying there now
in the house helpless?</p>

<p>It was a terrible thought, and made him shiver, even
though at the time he was also burning with the heat.
Suffocation was just as bad as the fire itself; and Elmer
began to argue with himself that perhaps it was his sacred
duty to rush into the house in the endeavor to find Ty.</p>

<p>He looked at Landy and Ted with almost pity in his
eyes, and yet at that moment the young patrol leader
was proud of his chums. Never had there been a test of
endurance where the stake meant so much. If they could
save the Brady home surely that were far better than any
prize which might have fallen to their prowess because
of a great hike, or a swimming distance match!</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard Landy give a shrill yell.</p>

<p>"There he is, Elmer! Hurrah for Ty!"</p>

<p>The fat boy was pointing a trembling finger upward;
and following its general direction Elmer saw a head thrust
forth from a certain window in the second story.</p>

<p>Ty did not seem disposed to pay the slightest attention
to his chums, though the three of them stood there waving
their hands and shouting. He was beckoning wildly to
the little girl who had been standing near by all the while,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
with her eager eyes riveted on the window above, just as
though she expected a miracle to be wrought in her
favor.</p>

<p>When Ty's head poked into view as through a curtain, for
eddies of smoke were all around the scout, the child began
to dance up and down, and clap her hands. At that moment
Ty Collins came nearer to being a real hero in the
eyes of a girl than ever before in all his life.</p>

<p>"Come closer!" he shouted, and as she did so, he continued:
"Where did you say Bennie was, up here? Is
this the room?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she replied, nodding her head at the same
time, as if in fear lest he might not hear her childish
voice in the midst of so much noise, with women calling,
and newcomers asking questions as they reached the scene.</p>

<p>"Where did you leave him?" demanded the intrepid
rescuer.</p>

<p>"Over in the corner&mdash;the box on the floor&mdash;Bennie was
naughty, and he had to be punished!" she cried at the
top of her shrill voice.</p>

<p>Ty immediately disappeared, while his three chums
below waited with astonishment written on their faces,
not knowing what it all meant.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that, Elmer?" demanded Landy, plucking
at the wet sleeve of the other. "She said the baby
was in a box! Don't that beat the Dutch, though? Whatever
could she have been thinking of to do such a thing?"</p>

<p>"It wath the thillieth ever!" declared Ted, "thtuffing
a baby in a box jutht like he wath a rag doll!"</p>

<p>"Hold on and see," said Elmer, who must have had
some sort of suspicion as to the true state of affairs.</p>

<p>All eyes were riveted on that window. Seconds passed
as before, and the boys began to get nervous again because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Ty failed to appear. Had he found the baby really
smothered? Was he attempting to carry the poor little
darling down the stairs through all that dreadful smoke?</p>

<p>"Oh, look! look!" cried Landy.</p>

<p>There was no need of his saying this, because everyone
near by had been watching that window eagerly, and no
doubt saw what was happening just as quickly as the fat
boy did; but then Landy was so worked up with excitement
that he could not restrain himself.</p>

<p>Yes, Ty was there in full sight again. This time he was
leaning from the window, and seemed to be holding something
in his arms.</p>

<p>"Hold on there, Ty," shouted Ted, feeling a thrill of
horror, as he fancied his fellow scout must be about to
heave the poor little innocent darling from that second
story window, in the hope of somebody catching it before
it could reach the ground. "Give uth a thanthe to get
under firtht."</p>

<p>"Yes, hold your horses, old fellow!" panted Landy, as
he started forward with outstretched arms.</p>

<p>But, singular to say, Ty seemed to pay little or no attention
to their demands; though Elmer was sure he could
see a broad grin on the blackened face of the one who
leaned out of the window to get away from the smoke.</p>

<p>"Here, take your baby, little girl!" he shouted hoarsely,
as he began to lower away on a strange rope, which
Elmer decided he must have made by tearing a sheet into
long strips, and tying these together.</p>

<p>Something came down, foot by foot&mdash;something that
struggled, and made frantic attempts at getting free from
the encircling rope.</p>

<p>"Wow! it's a pup!" shrieked the astonished Landy.</p>

<p>"Well, I do declare!" echoed Ted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Elmer laughed aloud, as he started once more at the
task of emptying several buckets that had meanwhile arrived
at the end of the human chain. For wise Elmer
had guessed the truth before the moment when the other
two made their discovery.</p>

<p>The little girl darted forward and snatched the small
woolly dog up the moment it touched the ground. She
began to hug "Bennie" with all the ardor of an indulgent
little mistress; and, then freeing him from the torn
sheet, ran off toward the women as if to show her recovered
prize to her mother.</p>

<p>"Now come down yourself, Ty!" shouted Elmer.
"Don't you think of going back by way of the stairs, d'ye
hear?"</p>

<p>Ty waved his hand. Perhaps his voice was utterly gone
by this time, thanks to the smoke and his exertions. They
saw him swing out of the window; and Elmer understood
from this that at least the scout had considerable power
left in his arms and lower limbs.</p>

<p>Now his feet were on a little ledge that ran along the
face of the house above the lower windows. Ty had noticed
that a shutter was partly open and meant to make use of
this in his descent. It was a clever idea, and did the boy
great credit in the way of judgment. A veteran fireman,
accustomed to such things, could hardly have conceived a
better plan of campaign.</p>

<p>Once his feet were planted on top of this, Ty gave a
sudden move, and they saw him slipping down until his
ready hands caught the upper edge of the heavy blind.
After that he dropped to the ground in a heap, to quickly
stagger to his feet once more.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Ty!" shouted Landy, making the high
sign of fellowship in the direction of his chum; for he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
too busily engaged just then to think of abandoning his
buckets in order to rush to Ty's side so as to shake hands
with the hero of the occasion.</p>

<p>What if it was only a miserable little woolly pup that
he had managed to save from possible destruction; it would
have been all the same had it been the real baby that the
child had given him to understand was in peril. And Ty
need never feel ashamed of his brave act. It shed new
luster on the name of the Hickory Ridge Boy Scout troop;
and Elmer was determined that when the account was
written up, there should be no hint of humor in the same
that might reflect in any way on Ty's act.</p>

<p>Immediately Ty got busy again, and proceeded to fight
the fire with renewed vigor, though the poor fellow did
look as though he had almost reached the end of his resources.
Twice did Elmer tell him to drop out, and try
to recover; but for once Ty refused to obey orders, under
the plea that, as they were not really in uniform, it was
not obligatory on his part.</p>

<p>"Now something is going to happen!" said Landy, as
he brushed past Elmer while warmly engaged; and at the
same time he pointed across the open space to where a
party of stout farm hands had burst into view, running
as fast as they could toward the fire.</p>

<p>"More bucketh coming, boyth!" called Ted, who had
seen that each one of the newcomers was armed with at
least one big pail; which fact proved that they must have
suspected the cause of the wild alarm before they left
home, and had provided in this wise manner against a
dearth of vessels for fighting the flames.</p>

<p>When those fellows got busy, hurrying up from the
friendly creek, each with a fresh supply of energy, and a
pair of big buckets that were filled to the brim with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
liquid so needful in order to check the spread of the flames,
things began to look more cheerful.</p>

<p>"Now we've got it on the run, fellows!" cried Landy,
almost hysterical through sheer weakness, and his grim
determination not to give up so long as he could put one
foot before the other.</p>

<p>"Thay, look at that giant bringing a wath boiler full
of water at a time!" exclaimed the delighted Ted, almost
forgetting to lisp, so great was his excitement. "When
he geth thtarted, it'th good-by to the old fire. Whoop! hear
it thizzle, would you! Hit it again, mithter; it never will
be mithed! Now it'th your turn, Elmer. One, two, three,
and thet 'em up again in the other alley! We win, boyth,
we win!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HOW THE SCOUTS WON OUT.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> newcomers, whose coming the boys had noted with
pleasure, certainly showed signs of knowing how to fight
a fire in the country. In the first place, they had brought
their tools of trade along with them, in the shape of buckets.
Doubtless they remembered that on former occasions
the fire had gained headway simply on account of a lack
of receptacles for water.</p>

<p>Then they knew the brook, and that an abundance of
water could be had for the taking. Last of all every man
was full of vim, judging from the way they started in to
whoop things up.</p>

<p>Besides, their coming seemed to invigorate those already
on the ground, and who, by reason of long service, were
nearly exhausted.</p>

<p>"'Everybody's doin' it,' fellers!" gasped Landy, as he
staggered forward with his sixteenth bucket, and gave the
contents a fling.</p>

<p>"It'th a burning thame, what we're doing to that old
fire, don't you know?" laughed Ted, who followed close
on the fat boy's heels.</p>

<p>"Keep it going another round, boys," shouted Elmer;
"and by that time, I reckon, there won't be any more
need of water. We've saved the house, even if it is damaged
a little with water and smoke and fire. That's the
ticket, Ty; you're making a record worth while to-day, old
fellow! Once more to the breach; then it's rest for yours."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"All out!" cried Landy, in another minute, as he
dropped his bucket and sank in a limp heap on the ground,
a sight that would have caused his good mother to throw
up her hands in horror.</p>

<p>But Landy was proud of having had a chance to prove
his right to the name of a Hickory Ridge Boy Scout. He
grinned, and looked particularly happy; for he knew that
when the history of the saving of the Brady home was
written, his name would surely have a place of honor
among those who participated in the good work.</p>

<p>By this time there were fully forty people present. How
the news got abroad it would be hard to say. Some of the
farmers in that neighborhood had telephones, and in this
way it may have been passed along the line; but there
were many other methods in which the fire could have
made itself manifest.</p>

<p>New people kept arriving every few minutes; while a
few went away again to attend to the urgent business of
getting in their late crops.</p>

<p>The four scouts remained in a bunch, talking matters
over, and trying to recover a little from their tremendous
exertions before returning to the camp.</p>

<p>"Thay, how d'ye thuppothe the old thing got thtarted?"
Ted asked, with the natural curiosity of a boy.</p>

<p>"That's so," echoed Landy. "It must have been an
accident don't you think, Elmer?" for even in such a
matter as this they seemed to turn to the patrol leader
for information.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I can't say, fellows," replied Elmer. "At
this time in the morning the hands on a farm are out in
the fields, and the women washing up the breakfast things.
Perhaps they've got a gasoline stove here, and somebody
was careless. It happens now and then."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"But here comes Mr. Brady over this way; he may
know what started the old blaze," remarked Ty.</p>

<p>"Looks kind of smiling," ventured Landy; "which I
take it is some singular for a gentleman whose house has
pretty near gone up in smoke. Tell you what, I know why
he's heading this way, fellows."</p>

<p>"Then thay it right out, Landy," remarked Ted, who
had noted how the fat boy looked toward Ty and grinned.</p>

<p>"He's coming with a handful of thanks for our brave
chum here, on account of how he saved the little Brady
girl's darling baby, Bennie," said Landy.</p>

<p>"Huh!" snorted Ty, "I did my best, anyhow, and
that's all any fellow c'n do. How was I to know it was
only a silly little purp, and not a real human being?
Didn't she call it the baby? Laugh all you want, Landy;
but all I c'n say is that I reckon anyone of you fellers
would have done just as bad."</p>

<p>"And that's as fine a compliment as you could pay us,
Ty!" declared Elmer, heartily. "As for me, I want to
say right here and now that I'm proud of the way you
went into that burning house, thinking that a poor little
baby was in danger. In my mind it's just as if you had
done what you meant to; and I'm glad to own you as a
chum. Never mind if some fellows try to have a little
fun out of it; they don't mean anything by it. But here's
Mr. Brady."</p>

<p>The farmer was a heavy-set man in the prime of life.
He, too, had worked hard in the effort to save his house;
but despite his anxiety and fatigue, he approached the
four scouts with kindling eyes and an outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"I want to shake hands with every one of you boys,"
he said, earnestly. "Only for you coming when you did,
and takin' hold with such a vim, I guess the old Brady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
farmhouse would have gone up that time. I see you all
wear trousers and leggings that say you belong to the
Hickory Ridge Boy Scouts; and make sure that I don't
mean to forget this. I want the name of every one of
you, and I'm going to make it a point to see your folks,
to tell them what reason they've got to be proud of having
such boys in the family."</p>

<p>The way that horny hand of the farmer squeezed those
of the boys told that he meant every word he uttered.
Landy winced under the pressure, and came very near
crying out for mercy; only he remembered that this would
not seem just right, when they were at the time being complimented
on their manly qualities.</p>

<p>"We're only too glad that we happened to be coming over
to your place at just the right time, Mr. Brady," remarked
Elmer. "If we'd been at our camp, perhaps we
might not have known of the fire until it was too late to
do much good."</p>

<p>"Coming to see me, the four of you, were you?" said
the other, looking a trifle curious. "What could I do for
you, boys? All you have to do is to mention it: after
your noble work this morning I guess it'd be hard for me
to refuse any favor."</p>

<p>"But you see, sir," Landy exclaimed, "we didn't want
to ask a favor. Fact is, we wanted to do you one, perhaps."</p>

<p>"I have been looking around, Mr. Brady," observed
Elmer, "and I failed to see your two new hands working
to save the house&mdash;the short man and his tall mate."</p>

<p>Immediately the face of the farmer darkened, and they
saw his hands close with a movement that seemed to speak
of anger.</p>

<p>"No, you didn't, my lad, and for a very good reason,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
he said, breathing hard. "They turned out to be a pair
of rascals. My daughter caught them in the act of robbing
the house this very morning. I had sent them out
into a field back of the barns, and they knew that with
my son and the horses I expected to go to another part
of the farm. So they waited till the coast was clear, and
then sneaked back to the house, entering through a window
when the women folks were busy in the kitchen and dairy."</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped Landy, who had not dreamed that this
could be the explanation of the fire; "then they must
have been caught in the act, and did it for revenge?"</p>

<p>"Just what they did," replied Mr. Brady, with his teeth
gritting in anger. "My oldest daughter just happened to
go upstairs, and ran across them turning things upside
down in the search for valuables. She screamed, and knowing
that the rest of the women folks must have heard the
row, the scoundrels deliberately put matches to things, and
then, jumping from the windows, made off, laughing."</p>

<p>"Did they steal much from you, Mr. Brady?" asked Ty.</p>

<p>"That I don't know yet, because the fire took up all my
attention as soon as I got on the ground. And I don't
bother much about what they took, I'm that thankful about
saving my house, and that nobody was hurt," the farmer
went on.</p>

<p>"Not even little Bennie," murmured Landy; though
Elmer gave him a reproachful look.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," the patrol leader went on, "it happens
that we were just on our way here to warn you about your
new hands. One of our troop arrived in camp last night,
and told us a story about two tramps trying to wreck the
express train; and that the officers of several towns were
looking for them. When he described the fellows some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of us thought the two new hands might be the ones who
were wanted."</p>

<p>"Yes," Ty spoke up, "and if Elmer had had his way
we'd have come to see you last night; but the rest of the
bunch, being lazy or tired, voted to wait till morning.
Elmer knew best; he nearly always does."</p>

<p>"Well," the farmer went on, "it was nice of you to
think of giving me warning any time; and mighty lucky
that you were on your way here when the fire started.
Only for that there would be a heap of ruins here, instead
of my old house, which has been in the family many generations."</p>

<p>"You say the two men ran away, Mr. Brady?" remarked
Elmer, who felt more or less curiosity concerning
their movements.</p>

<p>"So the women folks say," came the reply. "Connie,
my girl, the one who came on them while they were turning
things upside down, looking under the mattresses of
the beds for money, and even under the edges of the
carpets. She says they ran toward the barns. But I had
the horses with me, so they didn't find a mount."</p>

<p>"Thay, perhapth they're hiding right now over there
in the haymow, or thomewhere!" suggested Ted.</p>

<p>"Oh, my goodness! That would be too good a thing,
wouldn't it?" cried Landy, scrambling to his feet, part of
his weariness seeming to leave him at the prospect of new
excitement.</p>

<p>"I never thought of that, now," said the farmer. "The
rascals might have made up their minds that, after all the
excitement was over, another chance would crop up to do
some clever robbery. Perhaps I'd be wise to get some of
the men together, and take a look through the barns."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Mr. Brady," said Elmer. "Because,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
unless I miss my guess, yonder comes a car that holds some
men in uniforms, and they may turn out to be officers
from Hickory Ridge, Fairfield, or some other place, looking
for information about these very two men."</p>

<p>"Bully! Wouldn't that just be the best thing ever,
to think of their happening here when we need them so
much," remarked Landy, staring at the coming ear.</p>

<p>"They must have been passing by when they met some
of the neighbors going home, and learned of the fire,"
ventured Mr. Brady, who made a motion with his arm
to attract the attention of the big, pompous-looking officer
who was getting out of the automobile.</p>

<p>"I know who he is," remarked Ty. "That's the head
of the police over at Fairfield. His name is Benchley.
I've talked with him more'n once. Why, he used to run
some sort of auction shop before they made him the chief
over there. And here he comes to interview us. My! Just
get on to his strut, will you, fellows?"</p>

<p>"Everybody look out how you talk when he's around!"
exclaimed Landy. "He looks as if he'd like to pinch
everybody around, and slap 'em into the cooler, just to
beep his hand in."</p>

<p>But Mr. Brady had stepped out to meet the man in uniform.</p>

<p>"What's been going on here, mister?" asked the officer,
with a heavy frown in the direction of the four boys;
as though he might be so accustomed to having his share
of trouble with the untamed youths of Fairfield and Cramertown,
that he naturally came to the conclusion, when
anything went wrong, in most cases, it could be traced
back to the depravity of the rising generation.</p>

<p>Evidently Mr. Benchley was always at war with the
boys of his town, which was one of the greatest mistakes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the head of the police force could make. In Hickory
Ridge they managed things better, for the chief there had
long since won the respect of most of the lads, who knew
they had a good friend in the head of the force.</p>

<p>"Been having a fire; but we were fortunate enough to
get it under control before much damage had been done,"
replied Mr. Brady.</p>

<p>"Did these chaps have anything to do with it?" demanded
the pompous man in uniform, again frowning at
Elmer and his chums.</p>

<p>"Sure they did, a whole lot," replied the farmer.</p>

<p>"Then you want them taken in, I reckon," interrupted
the officer, bracing himself, as though he might be ready
to sweep the four scouts into his car without further ceremony.</p>

<p>"Taken in?" repeated Mr. Brady. "Well, I should
say not. When I agreed with you that these lads had had
considerable to do with the fire I meant that only for the
grand work they did, my house would have burned to the
ground!"</p>

<p>"Then they didn't set the blaze going?" growled the
big man. "Who did, then?"</p>

<p>"Two men I engaged yesterday as farm hands; and
from what I hear I believe they are the very scoundrels
you are looking for this minute," the farmer replied.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SEARCHING THE HAY BARN.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Say</span> that again, please!" gasped Chief Benchley, as
he stared at the farmer, like a man who could hardly believe
his ears.</p>

<p>"I said I had reason to believe that the two hands I
hired yesterday must be the very rascals you are looking
for right now," repeated Mr. Brady.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;describe them, please?" said the man in uniform,
as he drew out a bulky notebook, and opened it at a certain
place.</p>

<p>"One was very short, a squatty sort of fellow, but
enormously strong. When I saw what he could lift I
thought I'd run across a good hand, though I own that I
didn't just like his face; but at this time of year farmers
can't be choosers, 'cause help is mighty scarce."</p>

<p>"Did he have a scar on his right cheek?" asked the
pompous chief of police, as he kept his eyes on his notebook.</p>

<p>"That's just what he did have; told me he had been
caught once by a reaper, and just escaped with his life!"
answered Mr. Brady promptly.</p>

<p>"So. And did you happen to notice his left hand, was
the upper joint of his little finger missing?" the officer
continued, in a sing-song tone.</p>

<p>"It certainly was," replied the farmer, nodding; "he
explained that in the same way; and I agreed with him
that he was lucky to lose only so small a piece, when he had
the mower catch him, as the horses ran away."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Settled then; that was Shorty McCabe beyond all
doubt," remarked the official. "Now how about his companion?
Was he tall?"</p>

<p>"Half again as big a man as the other," replied Mr.
Brady.</p>

<p>"Squint with one of his eyes; and talk as if he had his
mouth filled with hot mush?" continued Chief Benchley.</p>

<p>"You have described him to a dot," answered the other,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Then I have the honor to inform you, sir, that the men
who were lately in your employ are the identical criminals
we happen to be looking for at this very minute."</p>

<p>"I guessed as much," dryly remarked Mr. Brady; who,
it seemed to Elmer, had sized the important official at his
true value, which, as Landy afterwards declared, was very
much along the line of a "bag of wind."</p>

<p>"Please produce them, and we will see to it that they
give you no further worry," remarked the officer.</p>

<p>"I only wish I could, sir; but the fact is, that after
being caught robbing the house by one of my family, while
my grown son and myself were in the fields, they set fire
to things, and then ran off," the farmer replied.</p>

<p>"That is bad," remarked the policeman, sadly. "I
had thought you might have tied the rascals up, and that
we could relieve you of their care. Can you tell me in
what direction they fled, sir?"</p>

<p>"Toward the barns, my daughter says," Mr. Brady
replied.</p>

<p>"Evidently with the design of securing horses, and continuing
their flight," said the big man in blue, as though
these things were only for the practical mind of a man of
long experience.</p>

<p>"Hardly that, sir," the farmer observed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked Chief Benchley, frowning
at the idea of a mere countryman venturing to differ with
him.</p>

<p>"Because they knew in the first place that I only have
two horses just now, and both of them were being used by
my son and myself out in another field, some distance
away from the house. But one of these wide-awake lads has
suggested that perhaps they meant to conceal themselves
in the haymow, or about the barns somewhere, in the hope
that after all the excitement blew over, another chance
might open up to search my house for the money they need
to make a get-away."</p>

<p>The big man in blue wagged his head as he considered
this piece of information.</p>

<p>"Well, now, that might be worth looking into; it isn't
such a bad idea for a boy to think up. Perhaps we'd better
take a look through the barn, and make sure. Whether
we find them there or not, make up your mind the game's
nearly up for the rascals. When they get Benchley hot on
the trail, they're going to cash in and start for the pen
in short order. Lead the way to the barn, then, mister.
What did you say your name was?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mention it, but I'm Silas Brady. I was just
going to get some of the neighbors, and make the search
myself when you hove in sight, Mr. Benchley. But of
course I'd be only too glad to have you take entire charge,
for your long experience in such things will be of great
advantage to us," and catching the eye of Elmer just then,
Mr. Brady gave him a sly wink.</p>

<p>But the pompous man in blue did not see this. He
swelled out a little more, until Landy privately informed
Ty that he made him think of a proud pouter pigeon he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
had at home, which threatened to burst every time it strutted
around, with its lungs filled with air.</p>

<p>As they started off toward the barn the officer made a
sweeping motion with his arm that was apparently understood
by the three who had come with him in the car, for
they immediately headed as if to join him.</p>

<p>The farmer also spoke to quite a number of husky fellows
whom he knew as neighbors; so that there was a general
exodus from the vicinity of the house toward the out-buildings
of the place.</p>

<p>As the word was passed from mouth to mouth the
brawny farmers began to show some signs of excitement.
One of them picked up a stout cudgel, which he gripped in
a way to indicate that he anticipated using the same in
case of necessity; seeing which the others started to also arm
themselves.</p>

<p>It was quite a formidable force that began to surround
the barn and cowsheds.</p>

<p>"Wow!" exclaimed Landy, who had also snatched up a
wagon spoke upon which his eye had alighted, and seemed
eager for the fray; "countin' the four Fairfield cops, we're
just sixteen good and true men. My eye! won't Shorty and
Lanky Jim throw up their hands when they see what they're
up against!"</p>

<p>"If they get just one look at that Benchley," said Ty
in a low tone, "they'll nearly drop dead. Say, just see
him strut around, would you? He couldn't put on more
frills if he was a major-general, directing the Battle of
Gettysburg. This is as good as a circus, fellows, and I
wouldn't have missed it for a heap."</p>

<p>"Thame here," chuckled Ted. "And I wath jutht wondering
how he'd act if that hard faced little fighter, Thorty,
would pop out of a hole and jump him. Thix to one you'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
hear that big gath-bag holler for help like a calf. I know
hith breed, boyth."</p>

<p>Elmer did not make any remark; but if that little smile
on his face stood for anything it meant that the others
voiced his sentiments pretty clearly.</p>

<p>The surrounding of the out-buildings was now complete.
Chief Benchley made the round, stationing every man
afresh as though he did not want to lose the slightest bit
of credit for managing the affair. He was in his glory,
and looked as though the chance of a lifetime were now
within his grasp.</p>

<p>He had reserved several men to assist him in making the
search. Among these, two of his officers and the farmer
himself were to be seen. And as the official had scorned to
place boys on guard, because of the poor opinion he had
of them in general, Elmer and his chums were enabled to
trail into the barn after the searching party, an opportunity
they did not neglect to avail themselves of.</p>

<p>Twice did the pompous official turn a questioning eye
toward them, as though he might be inclined to order them
out; but on second thought he changed his mind, and said
nothing. As the scouts would have declined to pay any
attention to his orders, perhaps after all the Fairfield head
of police was wise not to attempt anything of the kind.</p>

<p>The Brady barns were unusually large, even for a big
farm. As quite a quantity of hay was stored here, waiting
until the market price rose in the winter, extensive space
was needed; though there were also three or four immense
haystacks in the rear of the buildings, as well as one of
straw, left when the threshing machine had passed through,
and the oat crop had been attended to during the summer.</p>

<p>"If anybody comes across any sign of the culprits, call
out, and the rest of us will hurry to the spot. Just shout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
out the words, 'Here they are,' and we will understand,"
the officer had said, as the party entered the big barn.</p>

<p>Then began a scene of bustle, as men went this way and
that, poking about for signs of those who were supposed to
be in hiding.</p>

<p>Of course all this could not be done without causing more
or less racket; and if the two tramps were close by they
must have discovered what was taking place early in the
hunt.</p>

<p>Elmer kept his three scout chums with him.</p>

<p>"We'll hunt in a bunch, fellows," he had declared.
"The Chief doesn't want us around him, so we'll look
in other places. Perhaps we can get trace of the ones we're
looking for."</p>

<p>"I just bet on you to figure it out, Elmer," remarked
the confident Landy.</p>

<p>"Shucks; Elmer could give that big bluffer all the
handicap going, and then beat him out. He don't know
beans, that's what," snorted Ty, looking scornfully over
to where the important party in uniform was walking about,
giving orders in a loud and consequential tone.</p>

<p>"Tell uth what to do, Elmer," said Ted; "and we'll
poke into every rat hole in th' old plathe."</p>

<p>"One thing's sure," the patrol leader went on, as he
looked thoughtfully about him, "if they made up their
minds to hide here, then they must have tunneled under the
hay, because that is the best of places for staying concealed."</p>

<p>"I second that motion," declared Ty, nodding his
head.</p>

<p>"And so we must keep on the watch for any signs of
a hole under the hay," Elmer continued, as he ran his eye
along the base of the mow close by.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Huh! looks to me like hunting for a needle in a haystack!"
declared Ty, after they had been industriously
at work for several minutes, without any success.</p>

<p>"Only one needle this time; the other's a blunt-headed
pin," chuckled Landy.</p>

<p>Ted began to sniff the air.</p>

<p>"Thought I thmelled thmoke," he announced as Elmer
looked at him suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Well, considering what has happened here lately," remarked
Ty, "seems to me that wouldn't be so very queer.
I'm just soaked with it, and expect to smell smoke for a
month of Sundays."</p>

<p>"But I thmell new thmoke!" Ted continued, positively.</p>

<p>"He's right, fellows; and I'm of the same opinion,"
Elmer went on to say.</p>

<p>Landy gave a short whistle.</p>

<p>"Smoke, did you say, Elmer?" he exclaimed. "My
stars, boys! what if the hoboes have set fire now to the
old barn? Say, what a blaze she would make, with all this
hay stored here. Me to let them pigs out of the sty if it
happens. It would be a shame to have roast pork when
they're only part grown."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean it, Elmer?" asked Ty, apparently
appalled by the thought of the terrible consequences that
must follow, should the pair of desperate rascals go to
extremes.</p>

<p>"It seems to be getting stronger all the while," observed
the patrol leader, "and look at Mr. Brady; he is sniffing
the air right now, as if he didn't like it any too well. I
reckon he's got the same idea I have; which is that the men
are in hiding here, and being afraid that they will be
found have started a fire to cover their escape. See, Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Brady is telling the Fairfield policemen his suspicions now,
and you can see that he's given him a start too."</p>

<p>"What a shame it will be if the barn goes, with all this
hay," said Landy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Brady's got it all insured, I reckon," ventured
Ty. "Farmers are smart enough these days to look
out for that. But it'll make a high old blaze if it gets
started, I tell you, fellows."</p>

<p>"But won't the thilly foolth be thetting the match to
their own funeral pyre?" demanded Ted.</p>

<p>"Not by a jugful," chuckled Landy. "Ten to one they
fixed all that before; and even made their old tunnel under
the hay. But that smoke is sure getting heavier all the
time, boys; and look there, ain't that the fire yonder? It
is, as sure as you live! Good-by to the old barn, and this
fine crop of hay. Say, look at it jump, will you?"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CAPTURE OF THE TRAMPS.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Elmer</span> saw at a glance that what his comrade had declared
was really true. And a loud shout from one of the
searching men announced that he too had discovered the
fire.</p>

<p>Tremendous excitement seized upon the whole party,
for they could readily surmise that this new conflagration
was not the result of a smoldering spark, but that it had
a meaning all its own. The two desperate hoboes must
have started the second blaze with the same idea in view
that had urged them to put the match to the farmhouse&mdash;to
divert attention while they slipped away.</p>

<p>That was what Elmer thought. And when most of the men
rushed toward the place where the fire was already burning
fiercely amidst the hay, he thought it good policy to turn his
attention to another quarter.</p>

<p>It had flashed across his mind just then that as they
passed around the barn he had noticed a board off, with the
hay sticking out of the hole. And now it came to him what
a splendid way of escape that same hole would prove, did
a tunnel under the hay lead to it.</p>

<p>The watchers outside had been summoned by the loud
cries of those within, and as they came rushing through the
wide open doors with the intention of trying to put down the
spreading fire, Elmer saw that the very condition which
those hunted hoboes must have wanted had been brought
about.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Outside, the way to escape was clear, so far as brawny
men went. If Lanky Jim and Shorty could only wriggle
along under the hay until they arrived at that place where
the board was missing, they had an open field before them,
and flight meant a chance to reach the shelter of the woods
beyond the fields.</p>

<p>"Come with me, and be quick about it, fellows," said
Elmer, in his most thrilling tone; at which Landy's big
eyes opened wider than customary, ditto his mouth.</p>

<p>The other three trailed along at his heels, wondering
what he could have in his mind. When all the men were
gathering in the barn, with the idea of trying to fight the
fire, it seemed strange that Elmer should lead them outside,
and away from the excitement.</p>

<p>But then by this time those fellows understood that the
patrol leader never did anything without having some good
and substantial reason for it. And they were, as a rule,
ready to follow blindly wherever he chose to lead, leaving
the asking of questions until a better chance opened up.</p>

<p>Had Doubting George been present, possibly he might
have tried to quiz Elmer ere he yielded full obedience;
but then even George must learn that one of the first duties
of a true scout is to exhibit implicit subjection to authority.</p>

<p>In this fashion then did Elmer lead his three chums
around the outside of the big barn. They could hear the
shouts of those who were fighting the flames within; but
Elmer knew only too well that the chances of the new
fire being subdued were small indeed. Hay burns with
frightful rapidity; and no buckets were handy at the
moment.</p>

<p>Turning, as he drew near the place where the board had
been torn from the back of the barn, he made a motion
with his finger that seemed to call for silence. The other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
fellows almost held their breath with suspense, still in
doubt as to what Elmer meant to do; although they began
to suspect that he must have conceived an idea looking to
the confusion of the incendiaries.</p>

<p>When he pointed straight at the place where some of the
new hay was sticking out, Landy's blackened face lighted
up with intelligence.</p>

<p>"He means they're expecting to crawl out right here,"
he whispered in the ear of Ty, who was close beside him.</p>

<p>The other made a suggestive movement with the club
he had picked up, and by which action he meant that it
would please him very much if only he had the opportunity
to bring it down upon the head of Shorty, or his long-legged
mate.</p>

<p>Then they all turned their eyes again on Elmer, expecting
him to tell just what he wanted them to do. They saw
the patrol leader pick up a piece of rope that happened
to be lying handy, and fashion a slip-noose with it. During
his life up in that big country of the Canadian Northwest,
Elmer had seen many things which he would never
be apt to forget as long as he lived. And, among others,
he had once watched the mounted police capture a half-breed
fugitive from justice, fastening his hands together
behind his back in a clever way, which possibly he might
now have a chance to imitate.</p>

<p>"Here, take this, Ty," he said, in a low tone, as he handed
the noosed rope over to the one nearest to him. "When I
whip the fellow's arms behind his back, make sure that you
get that loop around them, and pull tight! Understand?"</p>

<p>Ty nodded his head vigorously, not daring to trust himself
to speech. Things were happening so fast and furious that
really he hardly knew whether he might be awake, or else
asleep and dreaming them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course both Landy and Ted had also caught the significance
of the movement, and were ready to do whatever
they were told. Elmer made motions to give them to
understand that he wanted them to range up on the other
side of the hole in the side of the barn, and await developments,
while he and Ty crouched as close to the boards
across the way as possible.</p>

<p>Landy was heard to chuckle while this was going on.
Perhaps something about the situation reminded the fat
boy of other occasions, when he and some of his mates
had endeavored to clutch some rabbit as it came darting
out of its burrow, after a ferret had alarmed it, or a little
dog been let loose in the tunnel. But just now the game
was of an entirely different order, and Elmer frowned at
Landy's merriment.</p>

<p>Inside the barn the noise was redoubled. Evidently the
fire-fighters were having their hands full, with the rapid
spread of the blaze. If in the end they managed to control
the conflagration, Elmer felt that he would be surprised.
According to his mind there was not one chance in
ten of such good luck coming to Mr. Brady. He had saved
his house, but his barn would very likely have to go.</p>

<p>Elmer had his eyes glued on the projecting wisps of
hay now. He fancied that he had detected some little
movement to them, though this might be caused by a passing
breeze; or some action on the part of the energetic
fire-fighters within.</p>

<p>No, as he looked, he distinctly saw the hay move! Then
there must be a reason for this. Elmer instantly placed his
hand upon the hay, and the sense of feeling telegraphed the
truth to his brain. Some object was making a way through
the mow, and evidently pushing along a tunnel that had
been previously prepared!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned and put his finger to his lips, seeing which
every one of the wide-awake scouts understood what was
meant.</p>

<p>Imagine the strain on their nerves while they waited
for the appearance of the first tramp. Would he come along
head-first, or might they expect to see a pair of feet thrust
out of the opening?</p>

<p>More violently did the hay move. Whatever made the
stir, it was certainly drawing closer and closer to the spot.
All eyes were glued on the agitated dried grass, and Ty got
his loop in readiness for quick work.</p>

<p>Then something was seen pushing out through the hay,
which gave way before the energetic attack. Two extra
large feet, encased in brogans that looked as though they
might have covered many weary miles in their day, came
into view; proving that the man must be making a crab-like
retreat, keeping his face toward the fire.</p>

<p>Perhaps fortune favored the boys, for had the man projected
his head first he might have detected their presence
in time to duck in again; though for that matter, with the
fire burning briskly beyond, he would find himself <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'beween'">between</ins>
two evils, and must sooner or later issue forth, or be cremated
in the hay barn.</p>

<p>Waiting until the main part of the long-legged tramp
had wriggled into view, Elmer made a sudden gesture. The
others had been waiting for this, and instantly pounced
upon the figure that lay upon the ground.</p>

<p>While Ted and Landy deposited their combined weight
on the fellow's back, Elmer on his part hastened to snatch
hold of his arms, and whip them behind him almost before
the tramp understood what was happening.</p>

<p>Ty was waiting, and the way he slipped that loop over
both hands, and tightened it, was worth seeing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Having made all secure so far as things had gone, the
patrol leader now seized hold of the kicking legs, and began
to pull. As the others came to his assistance they were
hardly two seconds in dragging the tramp out of the hay
mow; and thus far at least not the slightest sound had been
made calculated to betray the facts to the other rascal.</p>

<p>It was not Elmer's intention to let the fellow see, just
yet, at least, that he owed his capture to a parcel of scouts.
He might burst out into a tirade, which, while it could do
him no particular good, might serve to warn the other
fellow, and cause him to change his plans.</p>

<p>Accordingly he motioned to Landy to sit down on him
again; and then bending low himself he pressed the end
of his pocketknife against the man's neck as he grunted into
his ear:</p>

<p>"Keep still, now, unless you want me to press the trigger!"</p>

<p>Satisfied that Landy and Ted could manage the tied
tramp, even if he started to kick up a row, which was
hardly likely, Elmer once more turned his attention to
that opening under the mow. Once again the projecting
hay was being violently agitated, and he believed the shorter
man must be following close upon his mate.</p>

<p>The programme would have to be repeated, and Elmer
only hoped as good success might attend his second effort
as had his first.</p>

<p>It would be a big feather in the caps of the scouts could
they say that they had effected the capture of the two
would-be train wreckers, alone and unaided. But at the
moment he was not thinking of such a thing as glory; when
it was a stern duty that had been suddenly thrust upon
them, and which they must not attempt to evade under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
any circumstances, if they wished to be true to the principles
of the organization to which they belonged.</p>

<p>Shorty, however, must have managed to change his position
in some manner, if so be he had started along the
tunnel in the same crab-like method of procedure which
his comrade had employed. For the first thing they knew a
frowsy head had been thrust out of the hay, and a pair of
eyes were blinking up at them.</p>

<p>Elmer was afraid lest the fellow draw back upon seeing
what awaited him, just as a tortoise will pull in its head at
signs of danger. Accordingly, he was determined not to
allow such a thing to happen. True, with the advancing
fire Shorty would speedily have to decide which fate he
must choose; but that might mean he would yield himself
a prisoner to the Fairfield police; and Elmer wanted the
Boy Scouts to get all the credit possible.</p>

<p>On this account, then, he pounced on the man, and
gripped him by the shoulders. Elmer was himself far
from a weakling, and the man happened to be taken very
much by surprise; so that before he could collect his wits
sufficiently to make any show of defense, he found himself
out on the ground, with a couple of energetic young fellows
hovering over him.</p>

<p>Ty, not having a second rope handy, had snatched up
his club again. When he saw that the shorter rascal was
starting to make a move, as though intending to get to his
feet, when trouble must have followed, Ty waved the
wagon spoke threateningly over his head, as he yelled
excitedly:</p>

<p>"Lie down, you, 'less you want me to let her fall!
Stretch out and roll over on your face, d'ye hear? Quick,
now, keep amovin'! 'Everybody's doin' it,' you know.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Now, Elmer, if you only had another piece of string handy,
there's a good chance to snug him up good and tight."</p>

<p>Elmer did not have the cord or the rope; but all the same
he was equal to the demands of the occasion. He snatched
his big red bandana handkerchief from around his neck.
He had seen such useful articles serve strange purposes
before; and why should this one not take the place of a
rope?</p>

<p>So he whipped it quickly around the thick wrists of the
man, almost before the fellow could get it through his head
what had happened.</p>

<p>"Now, let's pull them farther away from here, because
the barn's going to be a hot place pretty soon," Elmer
remarked.</p>

<p>Seizing hold, two to each prisoner, the boys succeeded in
dragging them some little distance off. Meanwhile some
one had noticed what they were doing, and presently the
Fairfield Police head came running out of the barn, rubbing
his smarting eyes, and, coming upon the little party,
stopped to stare in astonishment.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>GOOD-BY TO THE SWEETWATER.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> are you doing to those fellows, boys?" demanded
the champion of law and order; from which remark
it was plain to be seen that the smoke had affected the eyes
of the police officer to such an extent that he had failed to
recognize the culprits, and possibly believed the boys were
only carrying on high among themselves, as boys over in his
town frequently did, to the unhappiness of the constables.</p>

<p>"We just took a notion to prevent them from escaping,
sir," remarked Elmer. "And if you think you can hold
them, we're willing to turn them over into your charge,
in the presence of Mr. Brady here and the others."</p>

<p>A group began to cluster around them, most of the men
rubbing their smarting eyes. Already did they realize the
uselessness of trying to put up a fight against the flames
that were spreading resistlessly amid the hay.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare if it ain't the two hands that worked
for me, and then tried to rob my house, setting it on fire
as they ran away!" declared Mr. Brady, as he got a good
look at the prostrate men.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say these are the fugitives I have been
chasing, the desperate yeggmen named Shorty McCabe and
Lanky Jim Smith?" cried the police head.</p>

<p>"That's just who they are, sir," replied Elmer.</p>

<p>"But where did you find them?" demanded the other,
hardly willing to believe the plain evidence of his eyes and
ears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"As soon as I knew they had set fire to the hay I
guessed it was only meant to draw attention to that quarter
while they slipped away. I've seen that game played
more than once out West, sir," Elmer remarked, modestly.</p>

<p>"And it was a fact, was it; they did try to steal off?"
questioned the other.</p>

<p>"We found a place where there was a board off the
barn, and Elmer, he expected that was the way they'd
come out," said Ty, breaking in; for he just wanted this
consequential personage to understand that he did not
know so very much after all, in spite of his splendid uniform
and that wonderful strut.</p>

<p>"Which same they did, all right," spoke up Landy,
"and then, you see, we just sat on 'em. Reckon the long
feller must 'a' thought a mountain had caved in when I
dropped on his back."</p>

<p>"Will you take charge of the prisoners, Mr. Benchley?"
asked Elmer.</p>

<p>"That's what we're here for, young fellow; though, as
a rule we don't much fancy boys interfering with the pursuit
of justice," answered the other, who did not look any
too happy over the way things had turned out.</p>

<p>Elmer, on his part, was fully satisfied Mr. Brady and
a number of the others had crowded around, astonished at
the turn matters had taken, and staring at the two prisoners.
They would be in a position to prove, should it be
necessary at any time in the future, that the scouts had
indeed effected the capture of the hunted train wreckers,
without any assistance from the police.</p>

<p>And as for Shorty and Lanky Jim, it would not be polite
to tell what they thought and said when they discovered
that their captors were merely four half-grown boys. Perhaps
on first seeing the khaki trousers and leggings of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
scouts they may have labored under the impression that
the militia had been called out to ran them down; and this
would account for the meekness shown all along.</p>

<p>The barn was now in the grasp of the fire. They could
see the billows of flame leaping upward; and a dense black
smoke began to rise.</p>

<p>"This is tough luck, Mr. Brady," said Landy, after the
officers had fastened some shining steel ornaments to the
wrists of their prisoners, and led them over to the waiting
car. "After saving your house by a close shave, it's hard
to have your barn and hay go up in smoke."</p>

<p>But the farmer did not seem to be very deeply concerned.</p>

<p>"Barn's insured; and it's an old one at that," he remarked,
with a half smile; "and as luck would have it,
I sold all the hay in there just last week, for cash! The
man who bought it took out insurance, I believe. But you
boys have certainly covered yourselves with a lot of glory
this morning. First, saving my house, and then capturing
those tough characters. I consider that I'm getting off
mighty cheap. Hope some of you fellows will take a notion
to camp up this way more times than a few. It pays to have
Boy Scouts around. That's been my experience, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Well, how about milk, Mr. Brady?" asked Elmer.</p>

<p>"We brought that tin bucket along, but it's mixed up
with all the rest now. Suppose we could get one of your
women folks to go to the milk house with all this excitement
on?"</p>

<p>"Why, any one of 'em would be only too proud to do
such a little thing for the brave boys who worked so hard to
save a roof over their heads. And don't think, young
fellow," the farmer added, turning on the confused Ty,
suddenly, "that we don't appreciate what you did, just
because it turned out to be a pup instead of a baby. That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
was as bold a thing as ever I saw done. If I had any
boys about your age, I'd make sure that they joined the
scout movement before they were a week older. Seems like
it cultivates the best there is in a lad."</p>

<p>All of the boys glowed with pleasure at hearing these
hearty words.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Brady," said Elmer. "It sure is a
satisfaction to know that you look at things that way. And
we feel repaid for all we've done, don't we, boys?"</p>

<p>"It's only been a pleasure to play coon for you, Mr.
Brady," grinned Landy.</p>

<p>"And I'm glad it was only a dog instead of a real
baby," declared Ty, stoutly; "'cause, you see, something
might have happened to hitch my plans, and think what a
terrible thing would have happened then."</p>

<p>"Come with me, boys, and I'll see that you get milk;
yes, cream if you'd prefer it. It's lucky that those haystacks
happen to be as far off as they are, and the wind is
blowing away from them; because, you see, I kept that part
of the crop. Intended making a lot of repairs to the barn
after it was empty. Now I'll take the insurance money,
add some more to it, and build me a better place three times
over."</p>

<p>"There go Shorty and Jim," announced Landy, as the
car started off for the near-by public road.</p>

<p>"And they look at us as if they could eat us alive,"
commented Ty.</p>

<p>"I gueth thome of uth would rather thtick in their
throath," remarked Ted, gloomily.</p>

<p>"What ails you, Ted?" asked Elmer, as they trailed
along after Mr. Brady. "You don't look like you were
altogether happy."</p>

<p>"I know," announced Landy, a little maliciously. "He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
just wanted to get a chance to cut off a few arms and legs,
and such things as go with a battle. I could see it in his
eyes when it looked like we were going to have a real rumpus
with them train wreckers. And it all turned out so
easy, Ted is disgusted. Ain't it so, Ted?"</p>

<p>The budding surgeon of the troop shrugged his shoulders
and grunted the one word: "Rotten!"</p>

<p>And those boys, who knew Ted so well, could understand
something of the wild ambition that must have fired
his soul when he figured that one or more persons must
surely be seriously hurt, when the police came in contact
with the two house burners. But it had passed off, and now
the car containing prisoners and captors had gone, without
even one little blow having been struck on either side.</p>

<p>"What's the sense of knowing how to bind up wounds,
and do all that sort of stunts, when nothing ever happens;
that's what Ted is saying to himself," Landy remarked,
chuckling as he spoke, for he did dearly love to poke fun
at others.</p>

<p>"If you keep on," said Ted, with a dark look, "there'll
be a subject forthcoming in double-quick order. But somebody'll
have to sweep you up with a broom first before I
can do anything with you."</p>

<p>So Landy subsided, even though of course he knew that
Ted was only "talking through his hat," as he expressed
it, and for effect.</p>

<p>Having procured the needed milk, the four boys returned
to camp. Loud were the lamentations of George and Adam
when they learned what a great event they had missed by
not accompanying the others to the Brady home. At first
George, true to his nature, declined to believe a word of it;
but when he and Adam, urged on by curiosity to forget
whatever cause they had had for remaining in camp, hurried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
over to the scene of excitement, they heard the story
from numerous lips; so that the last doubt was laid.</p>

<p>The balance of the day was spent in resting up, for all
of them were sore from their unusual exertions, however
much they might try to hide the fact. Of course a plunge
in the river had soon removed all the smoke stains, and refreshed
them at the same time.</p>

<p>"It's lucky we had on our oldest trousers and leggings,"
remarked Elmer, when they came to examine into the condition
of things. "What with water slopping over the pails,
and the smoke and cinders, these are a sight right now.
But it'll wash out, fellows, and that's something our record
made this day will never do."</p>

<p>"Only one thing I'm sorry about," remarked Landy.</p>

<p>"What'th that! Anything to do with the way Ty here
thailed into that burning crib, and thnatched out the poor
little innothent lamb, Bennie?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"No. What I meant was that I forgot to take Lil
Artha's camera along when we started for the farmhouse,
because I never thought we'd have anything happen to us
worth remembering. Just think, boys, if I had snapped off
half a dozen views of that business, wouldn't they deserve
a frame in our meeting room?"</p>

<p>"Just what they would," affirmed Landy. "I'd give
anything if I had one to show my folks what a hero their
son and heir had grown to be. But then," he added, sighing,
"they wouldn't have known me with all that black
on my face."</p>

<p>"Come off!" cried George. "Anybody'd know you by
your elegant figure; I could tell you a mile away, with
one eye shut."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, George!" said Landy effusively, just as
though he really believed his cousin meant it. "I always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
knew you were a good chap, and could appreciate true
merit, no matter where found. It's worth something to
hear such splendid words of praise from one of your own
family. I'll treasure them for a long while, sure."</p>

<p>"Don't believe a word of it," remarked George, true to
his colors, and a doubter from the word "go."</p>

<p>Nothing more out of the way happened to the scouts
while they were in that snug camp on the Sweetwater. We
saw them first on that same stream, and it seems only right
that we should take our last glimpse of some of our friends
while they are still in camp.</p>

<p>When on the morrow they would start to wend their way
homeward, it would doubtless be with many regrets, for
they had certainly had a great time of it, all told. As
school duties began, the Hickory Ridge Troop of Boy Scouts
would not find so many opportunities for outings; but the
ties that had bound them together all summer still held
good; and no matter what the sport that engaged their
attention, these lads who had signed the roster under
Roderic Garrabrant's guidance were bound to be drawn
together with the strong affection of those who have the
same goal in sight, and look upon one another as "comrades
tried and true."</p>

<p>We shall hope to again meet with Elmer and his chums
ere long, and in new fields follow the fortunes of those good
fellows who formed the several patrols of the Hickory Ridge
troop.</p>

<h2>THE BIRDS OF THE UNITED STATES</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> birds constitute a large group of the animal kingdom.
Their chief distinguishing feature is their covering
of feathers. Another characteristic is the production of
their young enclosed in eggs.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Vultures.</span></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/hickory6page147.png" width="500" height="320" alt="TURKEY BUZZARD." title="" />
<span class="caption">TURKEY BUZZARD.</span>
</div>

<p>The name "vulture" is applied to a family of birds
of prey. The bill of the vulture is large and very strong;
the head and neck are almost naked, being very lightly
sprinkled with down. It is a carrion-devouring bird and
does not attack living animals. It displays marvelous quickness
in discovering a dead body. Vultures are generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
protected in the countries where they are found because
of their value in clearing away the putrid animal matter
which would otherwise be injurious as well as disagreeable.
The American vultures sometimes reach a large size
and are very powerful in flight.</p>

<p>The Turkey Buzzard and Carrion Crow, both of which
are vultures, are common in the temperate parts of America.
The Carrion Crow is found as far North as Carolina.
The Turkey Buzzard is not a true buzzard and is wrongly
so called.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Eagle.</span></div>

<p>Eagles are large and powerful birds. The flight of this
magnificent bird is very beautiful and imposing, but its
gait when on land is rather awkward. Its food is usually
smaller birds and quadrupeds such as hares, rabbits, etc.,
but it does not hesitate to carry off young lambs or sometimes
to destroy sickly sheep. It generally hunts in pairs,
one eagle watching at some height while the other courses
along the ground and scares the game from the bushes.
It lays two eggs of a yellowish-white color with brownish
spots on a nest composed of a great mass of sticks, brush
and grass. The young are fledged about the end of July.
While the young are in the nest it is very dangerous to
approach it as the eagles are then extremely fierce and
daring. Some instances have been related of children that
have been carried off by an eagle, but these stories are
very doubtful. Eagles have certainly been known to
pounce upon children and carry them a little way, but
there are no true accounts of children having been actually
taken to the eagles' nest, although there are many stories
founded on such a supposition. The beak of the eagle is
curved from the face, having a sharp point. Its wings are
long and large. They catch and kill their own prey, but
unlike the vultures will not eat carrion. The eagle which
is found in North America is usually the golden eagle,
and inhabits the Western States. The Indians called it
"the War Eagle." Its feathers are dark brown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Buzzards.</span></div>

<p>The family of Buzzards are distinguished by their short
beaks, large rounded wings and squared tails. They live
on small animals, reptiles and various insects.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/hickory6page150.png" width="389" height="475" alt="COMMON BUZZARD." title="" />
<span class="caption">COMMON BUZZARD.</span>
</div>

<p>The Common Buzzard, when searching for food, rests
upon some high branch, keeping a keen watch on the
ground, and waiting patiently until some small animal
makes its appearance or some bit of carrion is scented. Its
length is from twenty to twenty-two inches. In flight it
is rather slow and heavy. The bird popularly known as a
Hen Hawk is a buzzard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Falcons.</span></div>

<p>The falcons are also birds of prey. Hawks are members
of this family. The Peregrine Falcon is an inhabitant of
most parts of Europe, Asia, South America and North
America. It builds its nest on cliffs and lays from two
to four eggs which are spotted with dark red. It preys on
other birds; its strength and swiftness are very great,
enabling it to strike down its prey with great ease; indeed,
it has been known to disable five partridges in succession.
It changes the color of its plumage several times before it
arrives at full maturity. Its length is from fifteen to
eighteen inches.</p>

<p>The Sparrow Hawk feeds on mice, ground squirrels, insects,
small birds. It displays great pertinacity in pursuit
of its prey which it will chase for a long while, skimming
along a few feet above the ground. When taken
young it is easily tamed and will then associate with the
most incongruous companions. Its length is from twelve
to fifteen feet. It builds upon lofty trees.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Owls.</span></div>

<p>The owls are nocturnal birds, pursuing their prey by
night and sleeping by day. They have a large round
head with enormous eyes looking forward. Many species
possess two feathery tufts placed on the head greatly resembling
horns. In order to enable them to see their prey
their eyes are enormously large, capable of taking in every
ray of light. To protect them from the cold they are furnished
with a dense covering of downy feathers which also
prevents the movements of the wing from being heard.
The beak is short and horny, but very strong. They prey
on small animals, fish, insects, reptiles. The cry of the
owl is very peculiar and weird. This, coupled with their
strange appearance, has made them objects of superstition.
The ancients adopted them as symbols of wisdom. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
owls of North America that are the best known are the
Horned Owl, the Grayish-barred Owl and the Mottled Owl.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 364px;">
<img src="images/hickory6page152.png" width="364" height="500" alt="AN OWL." title="" />
<span class="caption">AN OWL.</span>
</div>

<p>The Snowy Owl also is found in North America; it is a
good fisher, snatching its prey from the water by a sudden
grasp of the foot; it also preys on small animals, chasing
and striking at them with its foot. It makes its nest on
the ground and lays three or four white eggs. Its length
is from twenty-two to twenty-seven inches. It extends its
wings four feet. There are some species of owl found in
America that burrow, living in the same hole with prairie
dogs, making their nest in the mouth of the prairie dog's
burrow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Cousins to the owls are the Nightjars, for example, the
night hawk and whip-poor-will. They feed on moths and
insects which they catch as they fly. Their eggs are laid
on the ground without a nest.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Swallows.</span></div>

<p>Swallows are remarkable for their great power of wing,
their wide mouths, their short legs and weak feet. Their
wing feathers are long, stiff and pointed, and their tails are
long and forked. Nine species of swallow are found north
of Mexico. They spend most of their time on the wing and
live almost entirely upon insects which they capture as
they fly; their large mouths particularly adapt them for
this manner of feeding. They nest frequently in colonies;
they migrate in large flocks and can often be seen in great
quantities at roosting places. They show skill in the construction
of their nests. The purple martin belongs to this
family; it is common in the South but rare in the Northern
States. The tree swallow builds its nest, of grasses and
feathers in the hollow of a tree. The bank swallow nests
in a sand-bank.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Swifts.</span></div>

<p>The swifts are often confused with swallows owing to
the similarity of their flight and the manner in which they
feed. A Chimney Swift, commonly but erroneously called
the Chimney Swallow, in construction is more like the
humming-bird than the swallow; they nest in chimneys
about ten feet from the top.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Kingfisher.</span></div>

<p>These birds are chiefly tropical, the Belted Kingfisher
being the only one of the family that is found north of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Texas. They feed on fishes and frequent the land near
the water and nest in holes which they make in a bank.
They perch on some limb overhanging the water and
watchfully wait for their dinner.</p>

<img src="images/hickory6page155.png" width="435" height="450" alt="HUMMING-BIRD." title="" />
<span class="caption">HUMMING-BIRD.</span>
</div>

<p>Eighteen species of these have been found in the United
States, but only one of these is found east of the Mississippi.
They feed on insects and also on the juices of flowers. The
humming-bird has no song, but the beauty of its plumage
makes up for this deficiency. It darts through the air
almost as quickly as thought; now it is within a yard of
your path&mdash;in an instant gone&mdash;now it flutters from flower
to flower to sip the dew&mdash;it is now a ruby&mdash;now a topaz&mdash;now
an emerald&mdash;now burnished gold. Its tongue is almost
like that of the woodpecker, being curled around the
head under the skin, and is thus capable of being darted
to a considerable distance; like many other little creatures,
it is remarkable for its assurance and impudence; it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
easily tamed for that very reason and has been known to
domesticate itself in an hour from the time it is captured,
and often when released has returned again to partake of
the dainties which it has tasted during its captivity. It
seems to have no fear and will attack any bird, irrespective
of size. The nest of the humming-bird is as dainty as the
bird <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'iself'">itself</ins>.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Wrens.</span></div>

<p>The American House Wren is larger than the European
wren, being about five inches long. It is of a reddish-brown
color. The nest of the wren is built in any convenient
cranny: an ivy-covered tree, the thatch of a barn
or a warm scarecrow are all used by this featherless little
bird. It is a good fighter and will attack bluebirds and
swallows. The nest is usually of an oval shape, always
covered on the outside with some material resembling the
color of the objects around it, such as green moss, if built
among ivy, or brown lichen, if built on a rock or in the fork
of a withered branch. The eggs are six or eight in number&mdash;white,
specked with reddish-brown.</p>

<p>The Carolina Wren frequents the undergrowth in thickets;
he is the most nervously active of all the wrens.</p>

<p>The Bewick's Wren is often found in the barnyard.</p>

<p>The Winter Wren builds its nest usually in the tree-roots
and heaps of brush.</p>

<p>The Marsh Wrens build their nests of a globular shape
with the entrance at the side, either attached to weeds or
tall grass, near or on the ground.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Warblers.</span></div>

<p>This is a very large family; they feed almost entirely
upon insects. They are the first to leave upon the approach
of winter and the last to come in the spring. They
migrate at night and thousands are killed annually by
dashing against lighthouses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The black and white warbler is streaked with black and
white and can be readily identified; it can be often seen
creeping under branches in search of its insect food.</p>

<p>The yellow warbler. What boy has not seen a "wild
canary"? It likes to inspect the gardens and shrubbery
around our houses, and consequently may be frequently
noticed. There are a great many more in this numerous
family.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Thrushes.</span></div>

<p>This is another large bird family. In it are the bluebird
and the friendly robin; their song is very sweet.</p>

<p>The wood thrush is less shy than the veery or hermit
thrush. It can be distinguished from the others by its
larger size and its ruddy color and the large black spots
covering its underparts. The veery's upper parts are cinnamon
color; its dress is finely marked and its sides almost
white; it inhabits the dense woods and does not frequent
the habitation of man as does the wood thrush.</p>

<p>The Hermit Thrush is distinguished by its red tail, which
is much brighter in color than its back; it comes early in
the spring and lingers long in the autumn.</p>

<p>There are probably few boys who do not know a robin
when they see one, nor does the bluebird need to be introduced.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Blackbirds and Orioles.</span></div>

<p>The Red-winged Blackbird has bright scarlet shoulders;
the rest of the feathers are mainly black; they frequent
marshes.</p>

<p>Orchard Orioles are to be found in the orchards, the elms,
the maples, and other trees of our lawns. This bird is remarkable
for the complete change he makes in his plumage,
from a dull yellow to a deep orange and black, the bird in
the summer presenting an entirely different aspect from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
that in the winter. He builds his nest very near the end
of a tall limb where it will swing in the wind like a hammock.</p>

<p>The Bobolink is another one of this family that changes
its clothes each year. It goes North as the bobolink and
goes South as the reedbird or ricebird.</p>

<p>The Purple Grackle comes to us early in the spring; its
plumage is an iridescent purplish and greenish black.</p>

<p>The Cowbirds build no nests; they deposit their eggs in
the nests of smaller birds. These eggs are hatched with
the others in the nest and the young birds clamor constantly
for food and often starve or crowd out the rightful
bird babies.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Thrashers, Mocking-birds, etc.</span>,</div>

<p>frequent the borders or the edges of the woods and have
considerable singing ability; possibly the best known of
this family is the catbird, so called because his most familiar
cry is similar to the plaintive "meow" of the cat.
Although very few seem to know it, the catbird is also a
fine songster.</p>

<p>The mocking-bird is a great singer, sometimes singing
throughout a particularly bright moonlight night as well
as all day long. While sitting on its eggs it is an exceedingly
courageous bird, attacking without discrimination
men, dogs, or any animal that may approach too near the
nest. The black snake is the special object of its vengeance.
The snake, which has perhaps just arrived at the vicinity of
the nest, and is contemplating a pleasant breakfast on the
young or eggs, is violently attacked by the enraged mocking-bird,
which, by repeated blows on the head, generally
destroys its enemy, and then, mounting on a bush, pours
forth a triumphant song of victory. The nest is made generally
in a bush or fruit tree, frequently close to houses,
as the bird is protected by the inhabitants. The mocking-bird
is often kept tame, in which case, so far from its imitative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
powers showing any decrease, the variety of domestic
sounds heard about the house is often very perplexing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/hickory6page159.png" width="500" height="405" alt="MOCKING-BIRD." title="" />
<span class="caption">MOCKING-BIRD.</span>
</div>

<p>The thrasher is also a vocalist of some quality; he likes
to sit where he can be seen when he is singing, generally
high up in the tree.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Flycatchers.</span></div>

<p>The flycatchers are songless; they are found all over the
United States. They remain on their perch, waiting for
a passing insect; when their prey is within sight they dart
after it and then return to their station.</p>

<p>The kingbird is grayish in color and bears a crest which,
when raised, reveals reddish feathers. He perches quietly
at his station, but is alert to every movement near him, and
rarely does a passing insect escape his keen eye.</p>

<p>The ph&oelig;be is very fond of building its nest under an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
bridge. His call is a monotonous, plaintive reiteration.
It sounds as though he were saying, "ph&oelig;be"; hence his
name.</p>

<p>Very common flycatchers are the Arcadian Flycatcher,
the Wood Peewee and the Least Flycatcher: the latter being
called the Least Flycatcher on account of its being the
smallest in size.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Shrikes.</span></div>

<p>The color of this bird is gray, black and white. It
causes fright at once among sparrows, on which it preys
as well as upon mice and insects. He has a characteristic
flight, flying steadily and in a straight line close to the
ground, flapping his wings. When he gets near his destination
he reaches it by a sudden upward movement. The
shrikes are often called "butcher birds"; they well deserve
their name; they transfix their prey upon a thorn
preparatory to devouring it, having darted on it from some
place of concealment after the same manner as the flycatchers.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Crows and Jays.</span></div>

<p>It will probably surprise you to know that the gaily
colored blue jay belongs to the same family as the dusky
crow. All of this family are great feeders, taking fruits,
seeds, insects, eggs and refuse; all of them possess great
intelligence. The blue jay seems to take positive pleasure
in teasing other birds; he is noisy and reckless; he nests
usually in the crotch of a tree from ten to twenty feet
high.</p>

<p>The crow's harsh voice, large size and black plumage
make this bird well known. Every boy who lives in the
country knows how fond the crow is of corn, and who has
not seen the scarecrows flapping their empty sleeves in
the winds of the cornfield.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Finches and Sparrows.</span></div>

<img src="images/hickory6page161.png" width="468" height="550" alt="BLUE JAY." title="" />
<span class="caption">BLUE JAY.</span>
</div>

<p>This is the largest bird family. They possess stout bills
fitted to crush the seeds on which they feed. The House,
or English sparrow, was first introduced into the United
States in 1851. The Crossbill derives its name from having
the tips of its bill crossed. They frequent pine forests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and the structure of their bills helps them in forcing the
cones open to get at the seeds within.</p>

<p>The Goldfinches are canary-yellow and black; they
travel usually in small flocks; in song they become at times
so ecstatic that it seems as if they would burst their little
bodies.</p>

<p>The Junco is a small, plump bird. When the summer
birds have left for the South the Junco comes from the
North.</p>

<p>The Cardinal is one of the gayest of our feathered
friends; its plumage is a rosy-red with a little black patch
at the throat and the crest; it nests in bushes, the nest
being composed of twigs, rootlets and lined with grasses.</p>

<p>The Indigo Bunting is blue as his name. You will find
him in old pastures among bushes and clearings. The female
of this bird is like a sparrow in marking, except for
the tinge of blue which you may discover in her plumage.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Tanagers</span></div>

<p>are closely related to the finches; all of them have pretty
clothes, especially the Scarlet Tanager, who is bright scarlet
with black wings and tail. It is well worth a day's tramp
to see one.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Waxwings.</span></div>

<p>The Cedar Waxwings arrive late in the spring. They
have a black line which runs through the eye; their upper
parts are brown, their head is greenish, their tails gray.
You will often find them among fruit and shady trees;
they like old orchards where they hunt for cankerworms.
They have red spots on their wings that look like drops
of sealing-wax.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Vireos.</span></div>

<p>Small insect-eating birds; they do not catch their prey
on the wing as do the flycatchers, but search for their
food on bark and leaves; they are pleasant songsters and
their nests are neat and well-rounded, suspended from the
fork of a branch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Woodpeckers.</span></div>

<img src="images/hickory6page163.png" width="416" height="500" alt="WOODPECKERS." title="" />
<span class="caption">WOODPECKERS.</span>
</div>

<p>The claw of the woodpecker is constructed of two toes
forward and two toes backward, which assist them in
climbing the tree-trunks; their tail feathers are pointed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and stiff and serve as a prop; the bill is adapted for
chiseling out the homes of grubs, insects, etc., in the bark.</p>

<p>The Downy Woodpecker. Its upper parts are black, scarlet
band on the neck, the middle of the back is white, while
the wing feathers are specked with white. You can often
see him in an orchard or in the trees on the lawn, picking
out the grubs as he climbs the tree-trunks and branches.</p>

<p>The Sapsucker has a scarlet cap; its back is black and
yellow, tail black; it feeds largely on tree juices.</p>

<p>Red-headed Woodpecker. Head, neck, throat and principal
parts red; back black and white; nests generally in
a dead tree.</p>

<p>The Flicker. The top of the head gray; red band across
back of the neck; back brownish with black bars; they are
frequently called "high-holes."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Pigeons and Doves.</span></div>

<p>The passenger pigeon is now practically extinct. Captain
Bendire, writing twenty years ago, says: "It looks
now as if their total extermination might be accomplished
within the present century. The only thing which retards
their complete extinction is that it no longer pays to net
these birds, they being too scarce for this now, at least in
the more settled portions of the country, and also, perhaps,
that from constant and unremitting prosecution on their
breeding-grounds they have changed their habits somewhat,
the majority no longer breeding in colonies, but
scattering all over the country and breeding in isolated
pairs." They used to be seen in enormous flocks, which, as
they migrated, really hid the sun, destroyed forests miles
wide, breaking down branches with their weight and wasting
the crops far and wide. This bird moves with extraordinary
speed and goes enormous distances. Many have
been killed in New York State with their crops full of
rice that they must have eaten in Georgia. That means
that they flew three hundred miles in six hours. In 1813,
Audubon says the air was literally filled with pigeons, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the midday sun darkened as in an eclipse, and the flocks
flew over him in countless numbers for three whole days.</p>

<p>The Mourning Dove is similar to the Passenger Pigeon,
but not as large.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span></div>

<p>The Grouse are as a rule ground birds and trust to
their ability to hide to escape detection, their color being
such as to make them difficult to detect against a background
of dead leaves. The Ruffed Grouse can easily be
detected by the drumming sound which it makes. This
drumming begins gradually and gradually dies away. The
sound is made by the male bird beating its wings in the
air. The young birds run about like small chickens. They
feed on insects, berries and seeds.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Quail.</span></div>

<p>Who has not heard the quail call across the fields "bobwhite,
poor bobwhite"? They like the fields of corn in
the fall; in the winter they journey to the deep woods;
like the grouse, they rely upon their coloration for protection
and will only take flight as a last resort.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Plovers.</span></div>

<p>In habit they are like the snipes; but their tails are
shorter and thicker. The Golden Plover may be found in
marshes and sand-flats; they can run very rapidly; they
may be seen as the tide goes out feeding on sand-flats or
sand-bars. After running a few yards they stop suddenly
and seem to take their bearings. It is well known by its
plaintive cry and the stratagems it employs to decoy intruders
away from its nest, or rather eggs.</p>

<p>The Killdeer is so called on account of the cry which
it utters; it resembles "kill-dee, kill-dee." It is found
usually in flocks and nests on the ground in a hollow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Cranes</span></div>

<p>frequent marshes and are fond of frogs, field mice, snakes,
etc. They have a loud cry. When in flight the neck is
not bent like the Heron's. They nest on the ground.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Herons and Bitterns.</span></div>

<span class="caption">HERON.</span>
</div>

<p>The Herons nest in flocks; the bitterns are not as sociable.
The latter inhabit grassy marshes, while Herons like the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
shores of lakes and rivers. The Herons fly with their neck
bent in between their shoulders. The American Bittern
lives in large grassy meadows; it makes a peculiar booming
sound which can be heard for a long distance. The Great
White Heron is found along the Gulf of Mexico and in
Florida. The Great Blue Heron is found further north;
its nest is usually in tall trees and is made up of sticks
and twigs. The Egrets belong to this family.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Spoonbills.</span></div>

<p>The Roseate Spoonbill is found only in the very Southern
parts of the United States and in small quantities; their
bill is large and flat, shaped at the end like a large spoon.</p>

<p>The Ibises find their food on mud-flats along the shores of
lakes and rivers. It consists of frogs, small fish, etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Snipes and Sandpipers.</span></div>

<p>The birds are also found near the water; they have long
bills which they force into the mud in search of their
food.</p>

<p>The Wilson Snipe nests in meadows and swamps. It
builds its nest on the ground and is a game bird popular
with the sportsman. The Snipe in its habits much resembles
the Woodcock; its flight is very singular, rendering
it a difficult mark.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The American Woodcock.</span></div>

<p>The presence of Woodcock can always be determined by
the holes which they make in the earth in search of worms;
these are known as woodcock borings. When the bird
is found near its nest or young birds it will feign an injury
and will endeavor in this way to lead you away from them.
The Woodcock frequents dense thickets during the day
and at night it leaves for swamps and meadows in search
of worms and insects.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Avocets and Stilts.</span></div>

<p>Called "The Wading Snipe"; they wade in shallow
water and can swim when necessary. The bill of this bird
is curved like that of the Curlew, but the curve is upward
instead of downward.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Rails, Gallinules and Coots.</span></div>

<p>The Rails live in marshes. The Gallinules live on marshy
banks of rivers, lakes, etc. The Coots are still more aquatic,
and are very noisy; all of this family lay their eggs on
the ground.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Flamingoes.</span></div>

<p>The Flamingoes formerly visited Southern Florida every
winter. Now their appearance is rare. The singularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
shaped beak of this splendid bird is peculiarly adapted
to its long and flexible neck. When the bird wishes to
feed it merely stoops its head into the water; the upper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
mandible is then lowest and is well fitted to receive the
nutritive substances which are entangled in a filter placed
on the edges of the beak.</p>

<p>The color of its plumage is a deep brilliant scarlet, except
the quill feathers, which are black. When a number of
these birds stand ranged in a line, according to their custom,
they present the appearance of a small and well-drilled
body of soldiers.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Swans.</span></div>

<p>Wild Swans are now rare birds in the United States.
They feed as they swim by putting their long necks and
heads under the water. They swim with great rapidity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Geese.</span></div>

<p>Watch the skies in the spring and when you see a V-shaped
flock of birds flying northward, the wild geese are
flying. It is said that the apex of the V is always an old
gander. They feed on vegetable matter, both in the water
and on shore.</p>

<p>The White-fronted Goose is common in the Mississippi
Valley and on the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>The Canada Goose travels many thousand miles each
year in its migrations.</p>

<p>Geese nest on the ground, the nest being made of grasses
and twigs and thickly lined with down.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Ducks.</span></div>

<p>The Mallard is the origin of our domestic bird, and is
widely spread over the northern parts of Europe, Asia
and America. In the winter it migrates in countless flocks
to the warmer States.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/hickory6page171.png" width="500" height="305" alt="WILD DUCK." title="" />
<span class="caption">WILD DUCK.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>The Black Duck is sometimes called the Black Mallard.
The Red-head Duck along the Atlantic Coast feeds in salt
water. The Canvasback is in great demand on account
of the superior quality of its flesh as food. Both the Red-head
and Canvasback are fond of feeding on wild celery,
and it is said that it is this that gives their flesh the fine
flavor.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Pelicans.</span></div>

<p>These birds nest in colonies. Their flight is strong. The
White Pelican and the Brown Pelican are found in Florida.
It is a very conspicuous bird, its singular membranous pouch
offering a distinction perfectly unmistakable. The pouch,
when distended, holds two gallons of water, but the bird
has the power of contracting it so that it can scarcely be
discerned.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/hickory6page172.png" width="400" height="262" alt="PELICAN." title="" />
<span class="caption">PELICAN.</span>
</div>

<p>The pouch serves as a net in which to scoop up the fish
on which the Pelican feeds.</p>

<p>Another most important use of the pouch is to convey
food to the young. The parent Pelican presses the pouch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
against its breast, in order to enable the young to obtain
the fish, which action in all probability gave rise to the
fable of the Pelican feeding its own blood. Although web-footed,
it can perch on trees, although it prefers sitting
on rocks.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Cormorants.</span></div>

<p>Cormorants like the sea, but sometimes may be seen
inland. They, too, are colony birds. Their nests are made
of sticks and seaweed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">
<img src="images/hickory6page175.png" width="475" height="404" alt="CORMORANT." title="" />
<span class="caption">CORMORANT.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>The Cormorant is exceedingly voracious, and devours an
almost incredible amount of fish. It is an excellent diver,
and chases the fish actually under the water, seldom if ever
returning without having secured its prey. Like the otter,
when engaged in chase, it occasionally rises to take breath,
and then resumes the pursuit with renewed vigor. It has
the power of perching on trees, an accomplishment which
we should hardly suspect a web-footed bird of possessing.</p>

<p>The Cormorant is easily tamed, and its fishing propensities
can be turned to good account. The Chinese, at the
present day, employ a kind of Cormorant for that purpose,
having previously placed a ring round the bird's neck to
prevent it from swallowing the fish. Its length is about
three feet.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Petrels.</span></div>

<p>The Stormy Petrel is, under the name of Mother Carey's
Chicken, the terror of the sailor, who always considers the
bird as the precursor of a storm. It is the smallest of the
web-footed birds. Few storms are violent enough to keep
this curious little bird from wandering over the waves in
search of the food that the disturbed water casts to the
surface.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Albatrosses.</span></div>

<p>The Albatrosses are relatives of the Petrels, but much
larger birds.</p>

<p>The Wandering Albatross, the largest of the genus, is a
well-known bird in the southern seas, following ships for
many miles. The flight of this bird is peculiarly majestic.
Its extreme length of wing prevents it from rising at once
from the ground, but when once launched into the air it
seems to float and direct its course without effort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">ALBATROSS.</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Terns.</span></div>

<p>The Terns, or Sea Swallows, are possessed of great power
and endurance of flight, their long forked tails and pointed
wings indicating strength and swiftness.</p>

<p>It preys on fish, which it snatches from the surface with
unerring aim as it skims over the waves with astonishing
velocity.</p>

<p>They inhabit the seashore and, unlike gulls, make distant
journeys from the coast.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Gulls.</span></div>

<p>The Gulls are larger birds than the Terns. As the
vultures are the scavengers of the land, these birds are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the scavengers of the sea. They are frequently seen at
great distance from land, resting on the water. Their
nests are found in colonies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/hidkory6page173.png" width="450" height="541" alt="GULL." title="" />
<span class="caption">GULL.</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Puffins.</span></div>

<p>The Puffin is an excellent diver, plunging fearlessly from
a lofty cliff into the sea, and speedily returning with its
beak full of fish, which are secured by their heads, and
lie in a row along the bill of the Puffin, forming a kind
of piscatorial fringe. Its enormous and sharp-edged bill
renders it a formidable antagonist to intruders. It is
often called the "Sea Parrot."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Loons.</span></div>

<p>Inhabit fresh water lakes during the summer and the
sea during the winter. They can swim considerable distances
under water. Their nest is near the shore.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Grebes.</span></div>

<p>The foot of the Grebes is not webbed like that of most
water birds, but each toe is separated and flattened, so as
to serve as a separate paddle.</p>

<p>This book has attained a
larger sale than any baseball
story ever published.</p>

<p>The narrative deals with the
students of a large university
and their baseball team, the members of which
have names which enable the reader to recognize them
as some of the foremost baseball stars of the day before
their entrance into the major leagues.</p>

<p>One gains a very clear idea of "inside baseball"
stripped of wearisome technicalities. The book is profusely
illustrated throughout and contains also a number
of plates showing the manner in which Mathewson
throws his deceptive curves, together with brief description
of each.</p>

<div class='cap'>Many Cook Books have been published, from time
to time, to meet various requirements, or to elucidate
certain theories, but very few have been written to
meet the needs of the large proportion of our population
who are acutely affected by the constantly increasing
cost of food products. Notwithstanding that by its
valuable suggestions this book helps to reduce the expense
of supplying the table, the recipes are so planned that
the economies effected thereby are not offset by any
lessening in the attractiveness, variety or palatability of
the dishes.</div>

<p>Of equal importance are the sections of this work
which deal with food values, the treatment of infants and
invalids and the proper service of various dishes.</p>

<p>The recipes are planned for two persons, but may
readily be adapted for a larger number. The book is
replete with illustrations and tables of food compositions&mdash;the
latter taken from the latest Government statistics.</p>

character, clean, manly tone and the wholesome lessons
they teach without being goody-goody, make Alger
books as acceptable to the parents as to the boys. The
tendency of Alger stories is to the formation of an
honorable, manly character. They convey lessons of
pluck, perseverance and self-reliance.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
